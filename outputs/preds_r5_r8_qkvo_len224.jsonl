{"title": "QeMFi: A Multifidelity Dataset of Quantum Chemical Properties of Diverse Molecules", "abstract": "Progress in both Machine Learning (ML) and Quantum Chemistry (QC) methods have resulted in high accuracy ML models for QC properties. Datasets such as MD17 and WS22 have been used to benchmark these models at a given level of QC method, or fidelity, which refers to the accuracy of the chosen QC method. Multifidelity ML (MFML) methods, where models are trained on data from more than one fidelity, have shown to be effective over single fidelity methods. Much research is progressing in this direction for diverse applications ranging from energy band gaps to excitation energies. One hurdle for effective research here is the lack of a diverse multifidelity dataset for benchmarking. We provide the Quantum chemistry MultiFidelity (QeMFi) dataset consisting of five fidelities calculated with the TD-DFT formalism. The fidelities differ in their basis set choice: STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, def2-SVP, and def2-TZVP. QeMFi offers to the community a variety of QC properties such as vertical excitation properties and molecular dipole moments. Further QeMFi offers QC computation times allowing for a time benefit benchmark of multifidelity models for ML-QC.", "label": 1, "p_no_dataset": 0.8251953125, "p_has_dataset": 0.1749267578125, "pred": 0}

Luminescence is the process in which the emission of light from a given substance occurs. Band-shape luminescence nanothermometry is referred to as the luminescence of a system whose luminescence spectrum consists of several emission bands and lines, and the intensity at least of one of them is strongly temperature dependent.

{"title": "Generative Design of Functional Metal Complexes Utilizing the Internal Knowledge and Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in science, such as structure-property prediction and acting as AI agents, yet their intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capability for scientific discovery remains underexplored. We introduce LLM-EO, an integration of LLMs into evolutionary optimization, and demonstrate its success in optimizing transition metal complexes (TMCs). LLM-EO demonstrates advantages in few-sample learning due to the intrinsic chemical knowledge embedded within LLMs and their ability to leverage entire historical data collected during optimizations. Through natural language instructions, LLM-EO offers enhanced accessibility for multiobjective optimizations, potentially lowering barriers for experimental chemists without extensive programming expertise. As generative models, LLM-EO possesses the capability to propose novel ligands and TMCs with unique chemical properties by amalgamating both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and generation. With advancements in LLMs, both in their capacity as pretrained foundational models and new strategies in post-training inference, we anticipate broad applications of LLM-EO in chemistry and materials design.", "label": 1, "p_no_dataset": 0.241455078125, "p_has_dataset": 0.75830078125, "pred": 1}
{"title": "Multi-View Photometric Stereo: A Robust Solution and Benchmark Dataset for Spatially Varying Isotropic Materials", "abstract": "We present a method to capture both 3D shape and spatially varying reflectance with a multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) technique that works for general isotropic materials. Our algorithm is suitable for perspective cameras and nearby point light sources. Our data capture setup is simple, which consists of only a digital camera, some LED lights, and an optional automatic turntable. From a single viewpoint, we use a set of photometric stereo images to identify surface points with the same distance to the camera. We collect this information from multiple viewpoints and combine it with structure-from-motion to obtain a precise reconstruction of the complete 3D shape. The spatially varying isotropic BRDF is captured by simultaneously inferring a set of basis BRDFs and their mixing weights at each surface point. In experiments, we demonstrate our algorithm with two different setups: a studio setup for highest precision and a desktop setup for best usability. According to our experiments, under the studio setting, the captured shapes are accurate to 0.5 mm and the captured reflectance has a relative RMSE of 9%. We also quantitatively evaluate state-of-the-art MVPS on a newly collected benchmark dataset, which is publicly available for inspiring future research.", "label": 1, "p_no_dataset": 0.03515625, "p_has_dataset": 0.96533203125, "pred": 1}

{"title": "Predicting Solubility Limits of Organic Solutes for a Wide Range of Solvents and Temperatures", "abstract": "The solubility of organic molecules is crucial in organic synthesis and industrial chemistry; it is important in the design of many phase separation and purification units, and it controls the migration of many species into the environment. To decide which solvents and temperatures can be used in the design of new processes, trial and error is often used, as the choice is restricted by unknown solid solubility limits. Here, we present a fast and convenient computational method for estimating the solubility of solid neutral organic molecules in water and many organic solvents for a broad range of temperatures. The model is developed by combining fundamental thermodynamic equations with machine learning models for solvation free energy, solvation enthalpy, Abraham solute parameters, and aqueous solid solubility at 298 K. We provide free open-source and online tools for the prediction of solid solubility limits and a curated data collection (SolProp) that includes more than 5000 experimental solid solubility values for validation of the model. The model predictions are accurate for aqueous systems and for a huge range of organic solvents up to 550 K or higher. Methods to further improve solid solubility predictions by providing experimental data on the solute of interest in another solvent, or on the solute’s sublimation enthalpy, are also presented.", "label": 1, "p_no_dataset": 0.5595703125, "p_has_dataset": 0.440185546875, "pred": 0}
{"title": "Standardization and Normalization of Data from Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry", "abstract": "Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is a useful technique for the precise determination of major, minor and trace element distributions or isotope ratios in solid samples and biological tissue sections. However, measured ion intensities of selected mass-to-charge ratios, may vary considerably from run to run and might also underlie non-linear drift within a run. Therefore, beside the calibration of the measurement, normalization of ion intensities to a reference such as an internal standard is necessary. Other strategies use an endogenous reference element of which a homogenous distribution in the sample is assumed, or derive a more complex reference parameter from a given dataset. Generally, normalization methods depend on the experimental setup and sample material and are usually based on one or few isotopes or the total ion current. This chapter reports different normalization methods that either used a separate reference value for each data point – constituting a pixel in the isotope image – or used a constant normalization factor per measurement run. In conclusion, normalization is essential to minimize deviations of element concentrations due to measurement-related fluctuations. Normalization and definition of an area of interest are powerful tools to obtain high-contrast isotope images with absolute element concentrations.", "label": 0, "p_no_dataset": 0.98828125, "p_has_dataset": 0.01128387451171875, "pred": 0}
{"title": "Bio-mimetic Structural Colour using Biopolymers", "abstract": "The most striking and brilliant colours in nature are obtained by structuring materials on the scale of the wavelength of light, especially when these are combined with absorbing pigments. Such colourations, called structural, are the result of the constructive interference of reflected light with periodically organised interfaces within nanostructured materials. This means colour can be created from any material, transforming otherwise transparent or slightly absorbing polymers and composites into evolutionary assets of shimmering colours and hues. This chapter addresses the use of biopolymers to create structural colour in chiral materials, both found in nature, and the artificial use of biopolymers to create biomimetic structurally coloured materials in the lab. A physical and mathematical introduction to the optics of chiral structural colour is given and explained, along with a brief introduction to liquid crystal theory. An overview of the manifestations of biopolymer structural colour across the biological world is provided before a description of the most prominent artificial use of chiral structural colour using cellulose. A significant review of research into chiral self-assembled cellulose and the control of its characteristics forms the final section. The chapter finishes with a discussion of the contemporary and future direction of chiral materials, in particular those based on biopolymers, especially in their use as sensors and in templating techniques.", "label": 0, "p_no_dataset": 0.96337890625, "p_has_dataset": 0.037078857421875, "pred": 0}

{"title": "Enrichment Meter Dataset from High-Resolution Gamma Spectroscopy Measurements of U3O8 Enrichment Standards and UF6 Cylinder Wall Equivalents", "abstract": "The Enrichment Meter Principle (EMP) is the basis for a commonly used standard test method for the non-destructive assay of 235U enrichment in bulk compounds [1]. The technique involves determining the net count rate in the direct 186 keV peak using medium or high energy gamma-ray spectrometry in a fixed geometry. With suitable correction for wall attenuation, compound type, rate loss (live time), and peaked background (if significant), the atom fraction of 235U may be obtained from the counting rate from a linear relationship through the origin. The widespread use of this method for field verification of enrichment [2,3] together with the fact that the response function rests on fundamental physics considerations (i.e., is not represented by a convenient but arbitrary form) makes it an interesting example of uncertainty quantification, one in which one can expect a valid measurement model can be applied. When applied using NaI(Tl) and region of interest analysis, the technique is susceptible to both interference error and bias [2-4]. When implemented using high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, the spectrum interpretation is considerable simplified and more robust [5]. However, a practical challenge to studying the uncertainty budget of the EMP method (for example, to test linearity, extract wall corrections and so forth using modern methods) is the availability of quality experimental data that can be referenced and shared. To fill this gap, the research team undertook an experimental campaign [6]. A measurement campaign was conducted to produce high-resolution gamma spectroscopy enrichment meter data comparable to UF6 cylinder measurements. The purpose of this report is to provide both an introduction to and quality assurance (QA) of the raw data produced. This report is intended for the analyst or researcher who uses the raw data.
