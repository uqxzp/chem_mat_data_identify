Mechanistic models allow for a better understanding of the material on a micro- and macrostructural level while saving time and money over traditional experiment efforts. Historically, summarized data and correlations are the inputs for empirical material models and model validation. When improving these models for nuclear fuels with experimental results, there is a lack of reliable data readily available. Experiments - RERTR-12 and AFIP6-MkII - were conducted to understand the irradiation behavior of metallic U-10Mo monolithic fuels for use in extreme reactor environments such as research reactors like the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) or the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). Microstructural characteristics of fission gas pores (FGP) in each experiment are collected using an automated image analysis technique developed at the University of Florida and presented here. A series of statistical tests are performed to explore the reliability of the results, as well as understand where the data is lacking and what future data collection is necessary to provide sufficient information to assist modeling efforts. The focus is on the porosity, pore size, and eccentricity of FGPs formed during irradiation in three AFIP6-MkII samples and one RERTR-12 sample. From the analysis, it is clear there are substantial impacts of fission density on the pore structure, but there also exist also underlying connections between each sample and the behavior observed in the pores. Further analyses of the pre- and post-irradiation microstructure are needed to improve the understanding of these connections. An early method for microstructural data analysis is presented within and is currently being expanded to include other microstructure data."}

Our algorithm is suitable for perspective cameras and nearby point light sources. Our data capture setup is simple, which consists of only a digital camera, some LED lights, and an optional automatic turntable. From a single viewpoint, we use a set of photometric stereo images to identify surface points with the same distance to the camera. We collect this information from multiple viewpoints and combine it with structure-from-motion to obtain a precise reconstruction of the complete 3D shape. The spatially varying isotropic BRDF is captured by simultaneously inferring a set of basis BRDFs and their mixing weights at each surface point. In experiments, we demonstrate our algorithm with two different setups: a studio setup for highest precision and a desktop setup for best usability. According to our experiments, under the studio setting, the captured shapes are accurate to 0.5 mm and the captured reflectance has a relative RMSE of 9%.

The properties of nanoparticles are significantly different than their constituent atoms as well as their bulk counterparts, due to which they have potential applications in a number of sectors. Shape- and size-controlled inorganic nanoparticles can be produced by using ionizing radiation through generation of strong reducing radicals in-situ. The optical, mechanical, chemical, electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties of these nanoparticles can be fine-tuned by prudently optimizing the dose, dose rate and reactivity of the system. Although several synthetic routes are adopted by various researchers for preparation of nanoparticles, the radiolytic route is a relatively clean method, it is a room-temperature process and the product nanoparticle is free from external reducing agents or any by-products thereof.

Naturally degradable polymers are crucial for addressing polymer-related public dangers and preserving ecological harmony. One of the strong contenders among natural origin and naturally degradable polymers is polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). By virtue of their physicochemical qualities being proportional to those of synthetic plastics, they serve as a significant replacement for the synthetic plastics that are a major concern for causing huge damage to the environment. As the only type of naturally occurring biopolyester, it is synthesized under stressed growth conditions by a variety of microorganisms such as Pseudomonas putida, recombinant Escherichia coli, Bacillus megaterium, Aeromona scaviae, and Ralstonia eutropha. The most prevalent form of PHA found in nature is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate). PHAs show countless applications in agriculture, packaging, bio-refinery, biomedicine, tissue engineering, pharmaceuticals, and health owing to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and renewability. In this chapter, our objective is to present concise information regarding the properties of PHAs, commercial materials based on PHAs and how PHAs hold tremendous potential in substituting synthetic plastics as more environmentally benign plastics for applications ranging from domestic use, agricultural use, industrial use, construction activities, bioremediation, biofuels, and fine chemicals production."}

Because of their unique properties, aerogels have been extensively studied, not only for use as transparent thermal insulators but also as inter-metal dielectric materials, optical and acoustic applications, and the space industry (Muller et.al, 1999; Hrubesh et.al, 2001;Kim & Hyun,2003;Lu et.al,1991). NASA has applied aerogel on the Mars Pathfinder Sojourner rover and Mars Exploration rovers for insulation purposes. Additional applications of aerogels are found in battery electrodes, catalysts and electronic devices (Fricke et.al, 1992; Fricke & Tillotson, 1997; Kuhn et.al, 1995; Chadwick et.al, 2001). Currently SiO2, Al2O3 and C aerogels are reported and available elsewhere. During the production of aerogel a wet gel is formed which dried becomes filled with air. An aerogel is made up of microscopic beads or strand chains connected to form a continuous network, it is considered a solid. The fact that typical aerogels have more than 90% porosity gives them unusual characteristics (Yoda et.al, 1998; Klementiev, 2001). Their structure is composed of a 3D connected network of channels made of thin ligaments. The thickness of ligaments determines the final density and porosity of the aerogel (Reim et al, 2004; Kwon & Choi, 2000). As for thermal insulation application, generally monolithic SiO2 aerogels provide a whole low thermal conductivity due to its extremely high porosity. The thermal conductivity of aerogels is about 100 times smaller than that of full density silica glass, although Kistler made initial thermal conductivity measurements, a detailed understanding of thermal transport in aerogel resulted from investigations carried out (Fricke & Tillotson, 1997). Thermal transport in aerogel occurs via gaseous conductivity, solid conductivity and infrared radiative transfer. Usually at room temperature, aerogels have a low thermal conductivity due to its special gas conduction and solid conduction. However, at higher temperatures, radiative absorption/emission becomes the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Monolithic aerogel behaves poor thermal insulation because it is highly transparent in the 3– 8μm wavelength region. To improve its thermal insulation capacity, approaches such as doping aerogel with carbon have been applied to minimize infrared radiation heat transfer. The specific extinction for C doped aerogels is drastically increased, especially in the 2 to"}

First, a classification model was created to discriminate between injected and non-injected tuna samples. Then, a second classification model was developed to discriminate between non-injected and each water and additives treatment used. The results were promising, showing both models good results in the validation dataset. The first model, with 8 latent variables (LV), had an error-rate of 0.08 and an accuracy value of 0.93. It showed a good discrimination between injected and non-injected samples. The second model, with 10 LV, presented an error rate of 0.15 and an accuracy of 0.88. The discrimination between treatments was good even when protein hydrolysate solutions were used (sensitivity = 0.81; specificity = 0.99; precision = 0.87), a case which is typically hard to detect with accurate destructive analysis. This work opens new possibilities for onsite inspection in the fish industry, where NIR could be used as a complementary tool for the detection of water solutions in tuna."}

This project also incorporated theoretical methods to help select candidate materials families for testing. The Virtual High Throughput Screening served as a virtual laboratory, calculating structures and their properties. First Principles calculations were applied to various systems to examine hydrogen storage reaction pathways and the associated thermodynamics. The experimental program began with the validation of the MT assay tool with NaAlH4/0.02 mole Ti, the state of the art hydrogen storage system given by decomposition of sodium alanate to sodium hydride, aluminum metal, and hydrogen. Once certified, a combinatorial 21-point study of the NaAlH4 LiAlH4Mg(AlH4)2 phase diagram was investigated with the MT assay. Stability proved to be a problem as many of the materials decomposed during synthesis, altering the expected assay results. This resulted in repeating the entire experiment with a mild milling approach, which only temporarily increased capacity. NaAlH4 was the best performer in both studies and no new mixed alanates were observed, a result consistent with the VHTS. Powder XRD suggested that the reverse reaction, the regeneration of the alanate from alkali hydride, Al and hydrogen, was hampering reversibility. The reverse reaction was then studied for the same phase diagram, starting with LiH, NaH, and MgH2, and Al. The study was extended to phase diagrams including KH and CaH2 as well. The observed hydrogen storage capacity in the Al hexahydrides was less than 4 wt. %, well short of DOE targets. The HT assay came on line and after certification with studies on NaAlH4, was first applied to the LiNH2 - LiBH4 - MgH2 phase diagram. The 60-point study elucidated trends within the system locating an optimum material of 0.6 LiNH2 0.3 MgH2 0.1 LiBH4 that stored about 4 wt. % H2 reversibly and operated below 220 Â°C. Also present was the phase Li4(NH2)3BH4, which had been discovered in the LiNH2 -LiBH4 system. This new ternary formulation performed much better than the well-known 2 LiNH2MgH2 system by 50 Â°C in the HT assay. The Li4(NH2)3BH4 is a low melting ionic liquid under our test conditions and facilitates the phase transformations required in the hydrogen storage reaction, which no longer relies on a higher energy solid state reaction pathway. Further study showed that the 0.6 LiNH2 0.3 MgH2 0.1 LiBH4 formulation was very stable with respect to ammonia and diborane desorption, the observed desorption was from hydrogen. This result could not have been anticipated and was made possible by the efficiency of HT combinatorial methods. Investigation of the analogous LiNH2 LiBH4 CaH2 phase diagram revealed new reversible hydrogen storage materials 0.625 LiBH4 + 0.375 CaH2 and 0.375 LiNH2 + 0.25 LiBH4 + 0.375 CaH2 operating at 1 wt. % reversible hydrogen below 175 Â°C. Powder x-ray diffraction revealed a new structure for the spent materials which had not been previously observed. While the storage capacity was not impressive, an important aspect is that it boron appears to participate in a low temperature reversible reaction. The last major area of study also focused on activating boron-based materials in order to exploit the tremendous gravimetric capacity of LiBH4. A number of LiNH2 LiBH4 transition metal (TM) systems were investigated for the following reasons. No additional leads were discovered in this system. Another major project activity was the assembly of a high throughput synthesis system. The automated synthesizer was set up in a glovebox and was capable of handling liquids and powders and carrying out sealed block syntheses up to 250 Â°C. Unfortunately, the synthesizer could not handle the delivery of the fine powders required fro hydrogen storage applications. Although the powder delivery system was overhauled and redesigned several times, this problem was never remedied."}

This effort represents the first systematic study to determine what F concentration limits should be used for the design of alkali-borosilicate-based Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) HLW glasses, and to document the technical basis for that limit. If alkali borosilicate glass made from Hanford HLW can accommodate a large amount of F, the large capital costs for complex sludge washing facilities may be avoided, as would much of the operational costs and negative schedule impacts associated with handling the large volumes of water required to dissolve these salts. In order to determine a limit for F in likely HLW glass compositions, an evaluation was conducted on glasses with F ≤ 0.90 mass% from previous nuclear waste glass studies. The collected dataset contains 239 glasses (232 HLW glasses and 7 LAW glasses) including 109 glasses with 0.9 ≤ F mass% ≤ 2.5, 116 with 2.5 < F mass% ≤ 8.0, and 14 with F mass% ≥ 8 (max. F mass% = 17.42). The collected composition and property data were analyzed to determine the basis for the F tolerance, i.e. the maximum F concentration that can be processed without potential issues. Fluorine volatility, product consistency test (PCT) response, liquidus temperature (TL), glass melt viscosity, and crystallinity have been investigated. No limits for F concentration can be made based on F volatility, TL, or glass melt viscosity, because the data show that high F in glasses do not indicate, with high probability, being restricted by those property constrains. However, crystallinity and PCT response were used to estimate the F tolerance. The results show that glasses with high F (≥ 0.90 mass%) are more likely to form large fractions of F-containing crystal phases which may increase PCT responses, i.e. decrease the glass durability. Based on the results of crystallinity and PCT data, the F tolerance of 4.5 mass% is estimated. There is no evidence of other glass components, such as calcium oxides and alkali metal oxides have combined impacts with F on the glass properties. Overall, the available high-F glass data is limited, especially in the designed HLW glass composition regions. Future work on formulation and testing of HLW glasses with F ≥ 0.9 mass% will close the data gaps and expand operational flexibility with respect to the fluoride tolerances. Volatility of F from melters and corrosion of materials in contact with glass melts are important for processing of high-F wastes; yet no test data are currently available. It is recommended tests be conducted to address these two potential issues."}

Datasets such as MD17 and WS22 have been used to benchmark these models at a given level of QC method, or fidelity, which refers to the accuracy of the chosen QC method. Multifidelity ML (MFML) methods, where models are trained on data from more than one fidelity, have shown to be effective over single fidelity methods. Much research is progressing in this direction for diverse applications ranging from energy band gaps to excitation energies. One hurdle for effective research here is the lack of a diverse multifidelity dataset for benchmarking. We provide the Quantum chemistry MultiFidelity (QeMFi) dataset consisting of five fidelities calculated with the TD-DFT formalism. The fidelities differ in their basis set choice: STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, def2-SVP, and def2-TZVP. QeMFi offers to the community a variety of QC properties such as vertical excitation properties and molecular dipole moments. Further QeMFi offers QC computation times allowing for a time benefit benchmark of multifidelity models for ML-QC."}

Since the composition of protein mixtures can vary between cell types and can change under certain physiological conditions, one aim is often to quantify upor down-regulation of individual proteins. Characterisation of proteomic changes associated with disease often helps to shed light on disease mechanisms and identify useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets. It is rarely the case that such proteins are either “present” or “absent”, but more likely that they vary in abundance to different degrees. It is therefore important to have a sensitive and accurate method to measure these changes using an unbiased approach. Shotgun proteomics approaches enable identification of proteins that are up-regulated or down-regulated under specific conditions and this can be studied in different cell and tissue lysates. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQTM) make it possible to both identify and quantify proteins simultaneously. iTRAQTM can easily be multiplexed, enabling analysis of up to 8 different samples within the same experiment. Our objectives in this chapter are to place iTRAQTM (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) in context in the history of attempts to bring quantitative studies to proteomics, to explain what it can do, to describe in some detail the protocol that we use in this laboratory and to illustrate the application of iTRAQTM to medical and clinically-relevant problems, including our own work on the proteomic effects of common drug treatments."}

We introduce LLM-EO, an integration of LLMs into evolutionary optimization, and demonstrate its success in optimizing transition metal complexes (TMCs). LLM-EO demonstrates advantages in few-sample learning due to the intrinsic chemical knowledge embedded within LLMs and their ability to leverage entire historical data collected during optimizations. Through natural language instructions, LLM-EO offers enhanced accessibility for multiobjective optimizations, potentially lowering barriers for experimental chemists without extensive programming expertise. As generative models, LLM-EO possesses the capability to propose novel ligands and TMCs with unique chemical properties by amalgamating both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and generation. With advancements in LLMs, both in their capacity as pretrained foundational models and new strategies in post-training inference, we anticipate broad applications of LLM-EO in chemistry and materials design."}

They present two methods: the static one, ProbS, is based on an independent probability framework; and the dynamic one, HeatS, depicts input data as dependent peptides. Moreover, they use linear regression to adjust the matching score according to the masses of proteins. In addition, they consider the order of retention time to further correct the score function. In the post processing, they design two algorithms: assignment of peaks and protein filtration. Finally, they propose two strategies to estimate the false discovery rate.

The nano-dimension powders obtained by the precipitation process are, however, highly unstable with respect to grain growth, and will not necessarily remain in a finely divided and uniformly distributed state during heating to sintering temperature. As part of a larger study the morphology changes occurring during the calcination of nano-dimension hydrated aluminium oxide powder have been explored. Nano-powders were obtained by the controlled hydrolysis of aluminium isopropoxide and titanium isobutoxide solutions, either alone with homogeneous nucleation or in the presence of dispersed silicon nitride powder in which the metal-containing phase forms as a particulate coating on the larger silicon nitride particles. Phase and morphological changes were followed using X-ray diffraction, surface area measurements, and transmission electron microscopy. Significant changes take place during heating to 1400°C. Surface silicon dioxide on the silicon nitride particles appears to retard the crystallisation of α-Al2O3."}

Of course, it is great for the analyst to be able to draw on these richer datasets, but the volume and complexity of the data pose new data analysis challenges that cannot be addressed using tools developed for one-dimensional chromatography alone. In this chapter we first discuss recent advances in the development of methods for treating one-dimensional chromatography data, as these do indeed form the basis of methods for treating two-dimensional data. We then go on to discuss challenges unique to the analysis of data from multi-dimensional chromatography methods, and the methods that have been developed to address these challenges. Finally, we discuss multi-way analysis methods that not only are capable of dealing with multi-dimensional data, but are also well suited to capitalize on the power of these methods for resolving chromatographic signals from background signals, and from each other (i.e., mathematical resolution of overlapping peaks). Future advances in this area will benefit from the use of benchmark datasets that allow comparison of new data analysis methods to established ones, and evaluation of method performance using real data from multiple sources.

In the United States, there have been notifications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of intentions to apply for combined construction and operating licenses for 27 new units over the next decade. The projected growth in nuclear power has focused increasing attention on issues related to the permanent disposal of nuclear waste, the proliferation of nuclear weapons technologies and materials, and the sustainability of a once-through nuclear fuel cycle. In addition, the effective utilization of nuclear power will require continued improvements in nuclear technology, particularly related to safety and efficiency. In all of these areas, the performance of materials and chemical processes under extreme conditions is a limiting factor. The related basic research challenges represent some of the most demanding tests of our fundamental understanding of materials science and chemistry, and they provide significant opportunities for advancing basic science with broad impacts for nuclear reactor materials, fuels, waste forms, and separations techniques. Of particular importance is the role that new nanoscale characterization and computational tools can play in addressing these challenges. These tools, which include DOE synchrotron X-ray sources, neutron sources, nanoscale science research centers, and supercomputers, offer the opportunity to transform and accelerate the fundamental materials and chemical sciences that underpin technology development for advanced nuclear energy systems. The fundamental challenge is to understand and control chemical and physical phenomena in multi-component systems from femto-seconds to millennia, at temperatures to 1000?C, and for radiation doses to hundreds of displacements per atom (dpa). This is a scientific challenge of enormous proportions, with broad implications in the materials science and chemistry of complex systems. New understanding is required for microstructural evolution and phase stability under relevant chemical and physical conditions, chemistry and structural evolution at interfaces, chemical behavior of actinide and fission-product solutions, and nuclear and thermomechanical phenomena in fuels and waste forms. First-principles approaches are needed to describe f-electron systems, design molecules for separations, and explain materials failure mechanisms. Nanoscale synthesis and characterization methods are needed to understand and design materials and interfaces with radiation, temperature, and corrosion resistance. Dynamical measurements are required to understand fundamental physical and chemical phenomena.
