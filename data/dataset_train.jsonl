{"title": "Flash Chromatography Method Development", "abstract": "Flash chromatography is a rapid separation and purification technique used by organic, medicinal, and natural product chemists to isolate one or more compounds in crude chemical mixtures. Flash chromatography requires only a few items—a solid, inert sorbent, a sturdy, inert column, solvents, and a pump or vacuum source. Though, most chemists use automated flash systems with built-in pumps, gradient making capability, in-line detectors, and fraction collectors, all controlled by relatively simple-to-use software. As with any chromatographic technique, the results obtained are dependent on several factors so in order to insure success goals should be set. Chemists use flash chromatography for one reason—to purify and isolate the compound synthesized. Flash chromatography itself is not an overly difficult technique; however, it is the sample complexity that challenges most chemists. Thin-layer chromatography can be a chemist's most important tool for purifying crude mixtures.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
{"title": "Structural phase transitions", "abstract": "Aspects of phase transitions in crystals that are of interest to crystallographers are described in this chapter. The chapter starts with a brief introduction aimed at defining the field of structural transitions and the terminology used. The theory of structural phase transitions is then described. This theory relates the symmetry characteristics of the transitions to their physical characteristics. The application of the symmetry principles that derive from this theory is illustrated by the results contained in Tables 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.4.1. The first of these two tables concerns the simple but experimentally widespread situation in which a structural transition is not accompanied by a change in the number of atoms per primitive crystal cell. The second table concerns the general case, in which the number of atoms changes, and which corresponds to the onset of superlattice reflections at the phase transition. This table provides, for a set of hypothetical transformations, the various symmetry-based predictions of the theory. The important topic of soft modes, which is related to the microscopic mechanism of a structural transition, is then discussed.

In most such scenario microstructure dependent and corrosioninduced chemistry dependent property changes significantly affect performance of cladding, pellet, and housing. Emphasis of this work was on replace conventional pellet-cladding material models with a new straingradient viscoplasticity model that is informed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) based measurements and by nanomechanical Raman spectroscopy (NMRS) based measurements. The TEM measurements are quantitative in nature and therefore reveal stress-strain relations with simultaneous insights into mechanisms of deformation at nanoscale. The NMRS measurements reveal the similar information at mesoscale along with additional information on relating local microstructural stresses with applied stresses. The resulting information is used to fit constants in the strain gradient viscoplasticity model as well as to validate one. During TEM measurements, a micro-electro-mechanical system based setup was developed with mechanical actuation, sensing, heating, and electrical loading. Contrary to post-mortem analysis or qualitative visualization, this setup combines direct visualization of the mechanisms behind deformation with measurement of stress, strain, thermal and electrical properties. The unique research philosophy of visualizing the microstructure at high resolution while measuring the properties led to fundamental understanding in grain size and temperature effects on measured mechanical properties such as fracture toughness. A key contribution is the role of mechanical loading boundary conditions to deconvolute the insitu TEM based nanoscale and NMRS based mesoscale data to bulk behavior. First the literature based pellet cladding mechanical interaction model based on the work of Retel’s and Williamson’s in literature work to predict tempurature and stress distribution in cladding and pellet at normal operating condition was analyzed. Later the data was fitted to find constants for a viscoplastic strain gradient model. The developed model still needs to be refined and calibrated using various experimental results. That remains the focus of future work. Overall, a major thrust of the work was therefore on active control of the microstructure (grain size, defect density and types) exploiting the multi-physics coupling in materials. In particular, using experiments the synergy of current density, mechanical stress and temperature were studied to annihilate defects and recrystallize grains. The developed model is being examined for implementation in BISON. Multiple invited talks, international journal publications, and conference publications were performed by students supported on this work. Another output is support multiple PhD and masters thesis students who will be an important asset for future basic nuclear research. Future Work Recommendations: A nuclear reactor operates under significant variations of thermal loads due to energy cycling and mechanical loads due to constraint effects. Significant thermal and chemical diffusion takes place at the pallet-cladding level. While the proposed work established new experimental approach and new dataset for Zircaloy-4, the irradiation level was in the range of 1-2 dpa. Samples with higher dpa need to be examined. Therefore, a continual of support of the performed work is essential. Currently, these are the only experiments that can measure the produced data. The work also needs to be extended to different fuel types and cladding types such as SiC and FeCrAl based claddings. A combination of datasets for these materials can then be used to analyze accurately predict behavior of critical pellet cladding systems in accident scenario with high heat flux and high thermal loads.

In this paper, we show how to use a new Theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) to answer this. HT-SR suggests, among other things, that modern DNNs exhibit what we call Heavy-Tailed Mechanistic Universality (HT-MU), meaning that the correlations in the layer weight matrices can be fit to a power law (PL) with exponents that lie in common Universality classes from Heavy-Tailed Random Matrix Theory (HT-RMT). From this, we develop a Universal capacity control metric that is a weighted average of PL exponents. Rather than considering small toy NNs, we examine over 50 different, large-scale pre-trained DNNs, ranging over 15 different architectures, trained on ImagetNet, each of which has been reported to have different test accuracies. We show that this new capacity metric correlates very well with the reported test accuracies of these DNNs, looking across each architecture (VGG16/…/VGG19, ResNet10/…/ResNet152, etc.). We also show how to approximate the metric by the more familiar Product Norm capacity measure, as the average of the log Frobenius norm of the layer weight matrices. Our approach requires no changes to the underlying DNN or its loss function, it does not require us to train a model (although it could be used to monitor training), and it does not even require access to the ImageNet data.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

These results can be employed for validating cheaper low-level quantum chemical models or correcting the corresponding structures of large molecules. On these grounds, in this work, a large panel of semiexperimental equilibrium structures already available in the literature is used to confirm the average error (1 mÅ for bond lengths and 2 mrad for valence angles) of a version of the Pisa composite schemes (PCS2), which is applicable to molecules containing up to about 20 atoms. Then, the geometries of 30 additional medium-sized systems were optimized at the PCS2 level to cover a more balanced chemical space containing moieties poorly represented in SE compilations. The final database is available on a public domain Web site (https://www.skies-village.it/databases/) and can be employed for correcting structures of larger molecules obtained by hybrid or double-hybrid density functionals in the framework of the templating molecule approach. Several examples show that corrections based on the structures of building blocks taken from this database reduce the error of the B3LYP geometrical parameters of large molecules by nearly an order of magnitude without increasing the computational cost. Furthermore, the results of different density functional theory (DFT) or wave function (e.g., MP2) models can be improved in the same way by simply computing both the whole molecule and suitable building blocks at the chosen level. Then, whenever reference structures of some building blocks containing up to about 20 atoms are not available, they can be purposely optimized at the PCS2 level by employing reasonable computer resources. Therefore, a new DFT-cost tool is now available for the accurate characterization of large molecules by experiment-oriented scientists.", "label": 1}

{"title": "Modeling the tensile strength of hemp fibers and short-hemp-fiber reinforced composites", "abstract": "Ecological and economical considerations foster replacement of man-made fibers by natural renewable fibers in various industrial applications. Proper description of the scale effect of fiber strength is important for theoretical estimation of the load-carrying capacity of their products. Bast fibers of such plants as, e.g., flax, hemp and jute, are particularly attractive as reinforcement in polymer-matrix composites due to their high specific stiffness and strength. The elementary bast fibers exhibit pronounced strength scatter. This necessitates a probabilistic description of their strength via a distribution function that reflects damage morphology and severity in fibers. Fiber fracture is shown to originate from mechanical defects of the bast cell wall, the most prominent of them being kink bands. While the number of kink bands in a fiber is easily determined by optical microscopy, direct experimental measurement of their strength is complicated. Therefore, alternative approaches are sought, enabling extraction of strength characteristics of the kink bands from fiber tests via appropriate probabilistic models. An analytical distribution function of bast fiber strength has been derived, allowing for the effect of mechanical damage in the form of kink bands. The theoretical distribution is verified against experimental tensile strength data of elementary hemp fibers at several gauge lengths and found to provide acceptable accuracy in predicting the scale effect of strength.

Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) trained on a human-readable text description of the target crystal structure perform comparably to previous bespoke convolutional graph neural network methods, but better prediction quality can be achieved by training a positive-unlabeled learning model on a text-embedding representation of the structure. An LLM-based workflow can then be used to generate human-readable explanations for the types of factors governing synthesizability, extract the underlying physical rules, and assess the veracity of those rules.

{"title": "Machine Learning Models for the Lattice Thermal Conductivity Prediction of Inorganic Materials", "abstract": "The lattice thermal conductivity (κ_L) is a critical property of thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coating materials and semiconductors. While accurate empirical measurements of κ_L are extremely challenging, it is usually approximated through computational approaches, such as semi-empirical models, Green–Kubo formalism coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, and first-principles based methods. However, these theoretical methods are not only limited in terms of their accuracy, but sometimes become computationally intractable owing to their cost. Thus, in this work, we build a machine learning (ML)-based model to accurately and instantly predict κ_L of inorganic materials, using a benchmark data set of experimentally measured κ_L of about 100 inorganic solids. We use advanced and universal feature engineering techniques along with the Gaussian process regression algorithm, and compare the performance of our ML model with past theoretical works.

{"title": "High-Throughput Screening Approach for the Optoelectronic Properties of Conjugated Polymers", "abstract": "We propose a general high-throughput virtual screening approach for the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymers.

Parameters drawn from the resulting calibration using a linear model can then be applied to the xTB derived results for new polymers, thus generating near DFT-quality data with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost. As a result, after an initial computational investment for calibration, this approach can be used to quickly and accurately screen on the order of thousands of polymers for target applications. We also demonstrate that the (opto)electronic properties of the conjugated polymers show only a very minor variation when considering different conformers and that the results of high-throughput screening are therefore expected to be relatively insensitive with respect to the conformer search methodology applied.", "label": 1}

However, typical INVEST molecules have drawbacks like too low oscillator strengths and excitation energies. High-throughput screening could identify suitable INVEST molecules, but existing methods are problematic: The workhorse method TD-DFT cannot reproduce gap inversion, while wave function-based methods are too slow. This study proposes a state-specific method based on unrestricted Kohn-Sham DFT with common hybrid functionals. Tuned on the new INVEST15 benchmark set, this method achieves an error of less than 1 kcal/mol, which is traced back to error cancellation between spin contamination and dynamic correlation. Applied to the larger and structurally diverse NAH159 set in a black-box fashion, the method maintains a small error (1.2 kcal/mol) and accurately predicts gap signs in 83% of cases, confirming its robustness and suitability for screening workflows.", "label": 1}

{"title": "Principles of isomer stability in small clusters", "abstract": "In this work we study isomers of several representative small clusters to find principles for their stability. Our conclusions about the principles underlying the structure of clusters are based on a huge database of 44,000 isomers generated for 58 different clusters on the density functional theory level by Minima Hopping. We explore the potential energy surface of small neutral, anionic and cationic isomers, moving left to right across the third period of the periodic table and varying the number of atoms n and the cluster charge state q (Xqn, with X = {Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ge}, q = −1, 0, 1, 2). We use structural descriptors such as bond lengths and atomic coordination numbers, the surface to volume ratios and the shape factor as well as electronic descriptors such as shell filling and hardness to detect correlations with the stability of clusters. The isomers of metallic clusters are found to be structure seekers with a strong tendency to adopt compact shapes. However certain numbers of atoms can suppress the formation of nearly spherical metallic clusters. Small non-metallic clusters typically also do not adopt compact spherical shapes for their lowest energy structures. In both cases spherical jellium models are not any more applicable. Nevertheless for many structures, that frequently have a high degree of symmetry, the Kohn–Sham eigenvalues are bunched into shells and if the available electrons can completely fill such shells, a particularly stable structure can result. We call such a cluster whose shape gives rise to shells that can be completely filled by the number of available electrons an optimally matched cluster, since both the structure and the number of electrons must be special and match. In this way we can also explain the stability trends for covalent silicon and germanium cluster isomers, whose stability was previously explained by the presence of certain structural motifs. Thus we propose a unified framework to explain trends in the stability of isomers and to predict their structure for a wide range of small clusters.", "label": 1}

The distinct chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum depend upon each atom's local chemical environment and are influenced by both through-bond and through-space interactions with other atoms and functional groups. The in silico prediction of NMR chemical shifts using quantum mechanical (QM) calculations is now commonplace in aiding organic structural assignment since spectra can be computed for several candidate structures and then compared with experimental values to find the best possible match. However, the computational demands of calculating multiple structural- and stereo-isomers, each of which may typically exist as an ensemble of rapidly-interconverting conformations, are expensive. Additionally, the QM predictions themselves may lack sufficient accuracy to identify a correct structure. In this work, we address both of these shortcomings by developing a rapid machine learning (ML) protocol to predict 1H and 13C chemical shifts through an efficient graph neural network (GNN) using 3D structures as input. Transfer learning with experimental data is used to improve the final prediction accuracy of a model trained using QM calculations. When tested on the CHESHIRE dataset, the proposed model predicts observed 13C chemical shifts with comparable accuracy to the best-performing DFT functionals (1.5 ppm) in around 1/6000 of the CPU time. An automated prediction webserver and graphical interface are accessible online at http://nova.chem.colostate.edu/cascade/. We further demonstrate the model in three applications: first, we use the model to decide the correct organic structure from candidates through experimental spectra, including complex stereoisomers; second, we automatically detect and revise incorrect chemical shift assignments in a popular NMR database, the NMRShiftDB; and third, we use NMR chemical shifts as descriptors for determination of the sites of electrophilic aromatic substitution.", "label": 1}

To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of ~3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.", "label": 1}

The G2 test set includes 29 radicals, 35 nonhydrogen systems, 22 hydrocarbons, 47 substituted hydrocarbons, and 15 inorganic hydrides. It is hoped that this new test set will provide a means for assessing and improving new theoretical models. From an assessment of G2 and density functional theories (DFT) on this test set it is found that G2 theory is the most reliable method both in terms of average absolute deviation (1.58 kcal/mol) and maximum deviation (8.2 kcal/mol). The largest deviations between experiment and G2 theory occur for molecules having multiple halogens. Inclusion of spin–orbit effects reduces the average absolute deviation to 1.47 kcal/mol and significantly improves the results for the chlorine-substituted molecules, but little overall improvement is seen for the fluorine-substituted molecules. Of the two modified versions of G2 theory examined in this study, G2(MP2,SVP) theory (average absolute deviation = 1.93 kcal/mol) performs better than G2(MP2) theory (2.04 kcal/mol).

The effect of severe plastic deformation and subsequent annealing on key parameters of the Koiwa-Hasiguti acoustic relaxation in zirconium is studied in detail. It is established that due to intensive plastic deformation the relaxation strength considerably increases and the temperature and the width of the corresponding relaxation peak systematically decrease with reduction of the mean grain size in the samples. Annealing leads to a partial recovery of the relaxation strength and the peak temperature back to the initial values in undeformed samples but the width of the relaxation peak shows an additional decrease. The majority of the effects observed can be explained by changes in dislocation subsystems of the samples during intensive plastic deformation and annealing. An influence of a random scatter of the relaxation time on the main parameters of the Koiwa-Hasiguti peak is established using the statistical analysis based on the lognormal distribution. It is shown, that the parameter b of the lognormal distribution determines the width, height and asymmetry of the peak and also allows estimating the relaxation strength from the peak height.

{"title": "Machine Learning for Organic Cage Property Prediction", "abstract": "We use machine learning to predict shape persistence and cavity size in porous organic cages. The majority of hypothetical organic cages suffer from a lack of shape persistence and as a result lack intrinsic porosity, rendering them unsuitable for many applications. We have created the largest computational database of these molecules to date, numbering 63,472 cages, formed through a range of reaction chemistries and in multiple topologies. We study our database and identify features which lead to the formation of shape persistent cages. We find that the imine condensation of trialdehydes and diamines in a [4+6] reaction is the most likely to result in shape persistent cages, whereas thiol reactions are most likely to give collapsed cages. Using this database, we develop machine learning models capable of predicting shape persistence with an accuracy of up to 93%, reducing the time taken to predict this property to milliseconds, and removing the need for specialist software. In addition, we develop machine learning models for two other key properties of these molecules, cavity size and symmetry.

{"title": "Extending quantum-mechanical benchmark accuracy to biological ligand-pocket interactions", "abstract": "Predicting the binding affinity of ligand molecules to protein pockets is a key step in the drug design pipeline. The flexibility of ligand-pocket motifs arises from a wide range of attractive and repulsive electronic interactions invoked upon binding. Accurately accounting for all these interactions on equal footing requires robust quantum-mechanical (QM) benchmarks, which are scarce for ligand-pocket systems. In addition, the puzzling disagreement between “gold standard” Coupled Cluster (CCSD(T)) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods [Nat. Commun. 12, 3927 (2021)] casts doubt on many existing benchmarks for larger non-covalent systems. Here, we introduce the “Quantum Interacting Dimer” (QUID) benchmark framework containing 170 non-covalent systems spanning equilibrium and non-equilibrium geometries that model chemically and structurally diverse ligand-pocket motifs. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory shows that QUID broadly covers non-covalent binding motifs and energetic (exchange-repulsion, electrostatic, induction, and dispersion) contributions. Robust and reproducible binding energies are obtained using two complementary QM methods: LNO-CCSD(T) and QMC, achieving mutual agreement of 0.3 kcal/mol. Analysis of this benchmark data reveals that several dispersion-inclusive density functional approximations provide accurate energy predictions, though they exhibit discrepancies in magnitude and orientation of atomic van der Waals forces, which could influence the dynamics of ligands within the pocket. On the contrary, semiempirical methods and widely used empirical force fields require improvements, particularly in capturing non-covalent interactions (NCIs) for out-of-equilibrium geometries. The wide span of molecular dipole moments and polarizabilities in QUID also demonstrates flexibility in designing pocket structures to achieve desired binding properties. Therefore, QUID sets a new “platinum standard” for reliable and reproducible QM benchmarks of NCIs in larger systems and enhances our understanding of biomolecular ligand-pocket interactions.", "label": 1}

This chapter elucidates a wide range of analytical techniques employed to detect and measure HMs in various matrices. The analysis of HMs is imperative due to their non-biodegradable nature and propensity to accumulate within ecosystems, resulting in ecological repercussions and potential risks to human well-being through the food chain. It encompasses both conventional and modern HM detection techniques. Classical methodologies, such as Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) with Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (AFS) are discussed. These methods excel in quantifying low levels of HMs in complex matrices due to their exceptional sensitivity and precision. Advances in analytical technology have yielded innovative approaches for HM analysis. X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) offer rapid, non-destructive elemental analysis, catering to in-situ and real-time monitoring requirements. Moreover, Chromatographic methods, e.g., Gas Chromatography (GC) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with diverse detection strategies (MIP-AES), provide separation and quantification capabilities, particularly for intricate metal species within matrices. Electrochemical techniques, including voltammetry and potentiometry, are employed for their selectivity and low detection limits. Recent developments in emerging technologies showcase the potential to enhance sensitivity, selectivity, and portability in HM analysis. Nanomaterial-based sensors and microfluidic devices are illustrative examples of these innovations. The swift on-site monitoring facilitated by these technologies enables prompt evaluations of environmental and health implications.

In retrospect, the research on metal nanoparticles has experienced a long track, from the early stage of polydisperse NPs in the 19th century, to the achievement of monodisperse ones by the early 21st century, and now finally to the atomically precise nanoclusters. Currently, atomic precision has been achieved in the 1–3 nm size regime (tens to hundreds of atoms). The establishment of the \"size-focusing\" synthetic methodology has played a major role, and mechanistic understanding (i.e., the \"kinetic control and thermodynamic selection\" principle) led to the generalization of the methodology and attainment of a series of atomically precise gold nanoclusters, including some other metals such as silver and alloy nanoclusters. Together with the post-synthesis conversion strategies, all these have greatly contributed to the establishment and flourish of this field.

The experimental crystal structure is available for the entire data set, whereas zero-temperature unit cell volume can be reliably estimated for a subset of 28 crystals. Hence, the availability of a benchmark data set for organic semiconductors in their solid-state form is important for assessing the predictive capabilities of computational methods concerning the structural and electronic properties of these materials. This work is aimed to provide such a data set for single crystals, which not only incorporate the most appropriate structural morphology for this purpose but are also of practical use in optoelectronics. Over time, numerous large and small data sets of crystalline organic semiconductors have been accumulated; however, these data sets were not specifically designed for benchmarking purposes. Available benchmark data sets for molecular crystals and clusters do not contain sufficient samples of extended π-conjugated molecules commonly used in optoelectronic applications.

{"title": "Effect of MgO Additive on Volumetric Expansion of Self-Degradable Cements", "abstract": "We identified hard-burned magnesium oxide (MgO) as a suitable expansive additive for improving the plugging performance of self-degradable, temporary sodium silicate-activated slag/Class C fly ash (SSASC) blend cement sealers into rock fractures in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGSs). MgO extended the volumetric expansion of sealers during their exposure to a hydrothermal environment at 200 C under pressures, ranging from 300 to 1500 psi. A great expansion ratc of 19.3% was observed by adding 3.0 wt% MgO under 300 psi pressure, thus promising to plug thoroughly inner fracture. When the pressure was increased from 300 psi to 1500 psi, the expansion rate of cement markedly reduced, corresponding to the formaLion of crack-free specimens and the improvement of compressive strength. However, with 3.0 wt% MgO, the specimens still engendered the generation of numerous visual cracks, although they were prepared under a high pressure of 1500 psi. The effective content of MgO in minimizing and eliminating the generation of cracks was 2.0 wt%, which provided a moderate expansion of {ge} 0.5%. The compressive strength of 2.0 wt% MgO specimens made under a pressure of 300 psi rose {approx} 1.7-fold to 4816 psi with an increasing pressure to 1500 psi.

{"title": "Ab initio studies of the impact of the Debye-Waller factor on the structural and dynamical properties of amorphous semiconductors: The case of a-Si", "abstract": "This paper presents a first-principles study of the Debye-Waller factor and the Debye temperature for amorphous silicon (a-Si) from lattice-dynamical calculations and direct molecular-dynamics simulations using density-functional theory (DFT). The effects of temperature and structural disorder on the intensity of the diffraction maxima and the vibrational mean-square displacement (MSD) of Si atoms are studied in the harmonic approximation, with particular emphasis on the bond-length disorder, the presence of coordination defects, and microvoids in a-Si networks. It has been observed that the MSDs associated with tetrahedrally-bonded Si atoms are considerably lower than their dangling-bond counterparts – originating from isolated and vacancy-induced clustered defects – and those on the surface of microvoids, leading to an asymmetric non-gaussian tail in the distribution of atomic displacements. An examination of the effect of anharmonicity on the MSD at high temperatures using direct ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations (without the harmonic approximation) suggests that the vibrational motion in a-Si is practically unaffected by anharmonic effects at temperatures below 400 K, as far as the present DFT calculations are concerned. The Debye temperature of a-Si is found to be in the range of 488–541 K from specific-heat and MSD calculations using first-principles lattice-dynamical calculations in the harmonic approximation, which matches closely with the experimental value of 487–528 K obtained from specific-heat measurements of a-Si at low temperatures.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

The key emphasis is on studying how the phonon spectrum can be modified using defect engineering in 1D and 2D systems. Our work with nanowires suggests that strong localization of phonons is possible due to twin defects oriented perpendicular to the axis of nanowires. This results in the reduction of measured thermal conductivity by three orders of magnitude. As a result of the significant reduction in thermal conductivity the phonon contribution to thermal conductivity becomes comparable to the electronic contribution. A significant fraction of the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity can be tuned by an electrostatic gate - a realization of a thermal field effect transistor and analogue of the electrical FET.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
{"title": "Prediction of Mohs Hardness with Machine Learning Methods Using Compositional Features", "abstract": "Hardness, or the quantitative value of resistance to permanent or plastic deformation, plays a crucial role in materials design for many applications, such as ceramic coatings and abrasives. Hardness testing is an especially useful method because it is nondestructive and simple to implement and gauge the plastic properties of a material. In this study, I proposed a machine, or statistical, learning approach to predict hardness in naturally occurring ceramic materials, which integrates atomic and electronic features from composition directly across a wide variety of mineral compositions and crystal systems. First, atomic and electronic features, such as van der Waals, covalent radii, and the number of valence electrons, were extracted from composition. The results showed that this proposed method is very promising for predicting Mohs hardness with F1-scores >0.85. The dataset in this study included modeling across a larger set of materials and hardness values, which have never been predicted in previous studies. Next, feature importances were used to identify the strongest contributions of these compositional features across multiple regimes of hardness. Finally, the models that were trained on naturally occurring ceramic minerals were applied to synthetic, artificially grown single crystal ceramics.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

In some cases, three-dimensional models highlighted peculiar morphologies in a way that two-dimensional representations cannot be considered representative of that particular object morphology anymore, like mitochondria for instance. Observations like these are taking scientists toward a more common use of 3D models to formulate functional hypothesis, based on morphology.

{"title": "Interpretable Deep-Learning pKa Prediction for Small Molecule Drugs via Atomic Sensitivity Analysis", "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models now play a crucial role in predicting properties essential to drug development, such as a drug's logscale acid-dissociation constant (pK_{a}). Despite recent architectural advances, these models often generalize poorly to novel compounds due to a scarcity of ground-truth data. Further, these models lack interpretability. To this end, with deliberate molecular embeddings, atomic-resolution information is accessible in chemical structures by observing the model response to atomic perturbations of an input molecule. Here, we present BCL-XpKa, a deep neural network (DNN)-based multitask classifier for pK_{a} prediction that encodes local atomic environments through Mol2D descriptors. BCL-XpKa outputs a discrete distribution for each molecule, which stores the pK_{a} prediction and the model's uncertainty for that molecule. BCL-XpKa generalizes well to novel small molecules. BCL-XpKa performs competitively with modern ML pK_{a} predictors, outperforms several models in generalization tasks, and accurately models the effects of common molecular modifications on a molecule's ionizability. We then leverage BCL-XpKa's granular descriptor set and distribution-centered output through atomic sensitivity analysis (ASA), which decomposes a molecule's predicted pK_{a} value into its respective atomic contributions without model retraining. ASA reveals that BCL-XpKa has implicitly learned high-resolution information about molecular substructures. We further demonstrate ASA's utility in structure preparation for protein-ligand docking by identifying ionization sites in 93.2% and 87.8% of complex small molecule acids and bases. We then applied ASA with BCL-XpKa to identify and optimize the physicochemical liabilities of a recently published KRAS-degrading PROTAC.", "label": 1}

{"title": "RHALE: Robust and Heterogeneity-Aware Accumulated Local Effects", "abstract": "Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) is a widely-used explainability method for isolating the average effect of a feature on the output, because it handles cases with correlated features well. However, it has two limitations. First, it does not quantify the deviation of instance-level (local) effects from the average (global) effect, known as heterogeneity. Second, for estimating the average effect, it partitions the feature domain into user-defined, fixed-sized bins, where different bin sizes may lead to inconsistent ALE estimations. To address these limitations, we propose Robust and Heterogeneity-aware ALE (RHALE). RHALE quantifies the heterogeneity by considering the standard deviation of the local effects and automatically determines an optimal variable-size bin-splitting. In this paper, we prove that to achieve an unbiased approximation of the standard deviation of local effects within each bin, bin splitting must follow a set of sufficient conditions. Based on these conditions, we propose an algorithm that automatically determines the optimal partitioning, balancing the estimation bias and variance. Through evaluations on synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of RHALE compared to other methods, including the advantages of automatic bin splitting, especially in cases with correlated features.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

{"title": "Matrix of orthogonalized atomic orbital coefficients representation for radicals and ions", "abstract": "Chemical (molecular, quantum) machine learning relies on representing molecules in unique and informative ways. Here, we present the matrix of orthogonalized atomic orbital coefficients (MAOC) as a quantum-inspired molecular and atomic representation containing both structural (composition and geometry) and electronic (charge and spin multiplicity) information. MAOC is based on a cost-effective localization scheme that represents localized orbitals via a predefined set of atomic orbitals. The latter can be constructed from such small atom-centered basis sets as pcseg-0 and STO-3G in conjunction with guess (non-optimized) electronic configuration of the molecule. Importantly, MAOC is suitable for representing monatomic, molecular, and periodic systems and can distinguish compounds with identical compositions and geometries but distinct charges and spin multiplicities. Using principal component analysis, we constructed a more compact but equally powerful version of MAOC—PCX-MAOC. To test the performance of full and reduced MAOC and several other representations (CM, SOAP, SLATM, and SPAHM), we used a kernel ridge regression machine learning model to predict frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ground state single-point energies for chemically diverse neutral and charged, closed- and open-shell molecules from an extended QM7b dataset, as well as two new datasets, N-HPC-1 (N-heteropolycycles) and REDOX (nitroxyl and phenoxyl radicals, carbonyl, and cyano compounds).

{"title": "Directly optimizing for synthesizability in generative molecular design using retrosynthesis models", "abstract": "Synthesizability in generative molecular design remains a pressing challenge. Existing methods to assess synthesizability include heuristics-based metrics or retrosynthesis models which predict a synthetic pathway. By contrast, an explicit approach anchors generation with “synthetically-feasible” chemical transformations, such that all generated molecules already have a predicted synthetic pathway. To date, retrosynthesis models have been mostly used as a post hoc filtering tool as their inference cost remains prohibitive to use directly in an optimization loop. In this work, we show that with a sufficiently sample-efficient generative model, it is straightforward to directly optimize for synthesizability using retrosynthesis models in goal-directed generation. Under a heavily-constrained computational budget, our model can generate molecules satisfying multi-parameter drug discovery optimization tasks while being synthesizable, as deemed by retrosynthesis models. We reaffirm previous findings that common synthesizability heuristics (formulated based on known bio-active molecules) can be well correlated with retrosynthesis models' solvability, such that optimizing for the latter may not be an optimal allocation of computational resources. However, going further, we show that moving to other classes of molecules, such as functional materials, current heuristics' correlations diminish, such that there is an advantage to incorporating retrosynthesis models directly in the optimization loop. Finally, we demonstrate that over-reliance on synthesizability heuristics can overlook promising molecules. The codebase is available at https://github.com/schwallergroup/saturn.", "label": 1}

{"title": "One-Electron Reduction Potentials from Chemical Structure Theory Calculations", "abstract": "Many redox reactions of importance in aquatic chemistry involve elementary steps that occur by single-electron transfer (SET). This step is often the first and rate limiting step in redox reactions of environmental contaminants, so there has been a great deal of interest in the corresponding one-electron reduction potentials (E 1). Although E 1 can be obtained by experimental methods, calculation from first-principles chemical structure theory is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative. Sufficient data are now available to perform a critical assessment of these methods—and their results—for two types of contaminant degradation reactions: dehalogenation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds (CACs) and reduction of nitro aromatic compounds (NACs). Early datasets containing E 1's for dehalogenation of CACs by dissociative SET contained a variety of errors and inconsistencies, but the preferred datasets show good agreement between values calculated from thermodynamic data and quantum mechanical models. All of the datasets with E 1's for reduction of NACs by SET are relatively new, were calculated with similar methods, and yet yield a variety of systematic differences. Further analysis of these differences is likely to yield computational methods for E 1's of NAC nitro reduction that are similar in reliability to those for CAC dechlorination. However, comparison of the E 1 data compiled here with those calculated with a more universal predictive model (like SPARC) highlight a number of challenges with implementation of models for predicting properties over a wide range of chemical structures.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

This is a unique feature for magneticresonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, as paramagnetic andsuperparamagnetic MRI contrast agents instead require conjugationor association of metals to these compounds to impart signalcontrast, which is less desirable. Furthermore, while conventionalproton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) and magneticresonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) also allow the detectionand quantification of metabolites, these techniques have alwaysbeen limited by their relatively low sensitivity, and as such imagesproduced using these techniques suffer from low spatial resolutionin vivo. In addition, hyperpolarization has allowed the detectionof organic compounds such as isotopically labeled pyruvate andlactate. However, this technique currently has challenges in imag-ing for more than several minutes after the administration ofhyperpolarized substrate in live subjects due to T1 relaxation of hyperpolarized spins.

{"title": "Controlling the Degradation Profile of Mg Biomedical Devices by Alloy Design and Thermomechanical Processing", "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg) alloys are gaining interest for biodegradable medical implant devices due to a good combination of mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Nevertheless, the fast degradation rates of Mg and its biocompatible alloys in the aggressive physiological environment impose limitations on their clinical applications. This necessitates the development of Mg based implants with controlled degradation rates to match the kinetics of the bone and tissue healing process and to avoid any complications or issues that might negatively impact surrounding tissues. The current study presents alloy design and thermomechanical processing to optimize the mechanical and biological properties of a new proprietary Mg based alloy. Its corrosion profiles have been evaluated by a combination of in vitro and in vivo experimental studies. The corrosion rates of laboratory samples and prototype devices have been examined via long term immersion studies by measuring the cumulative amount of hydrogen (H2) that is emitted by samples. The cumulative H2 measurements have a direct correlation to the mass loss that the Mg alloy samples undergo during the duration of the tests. The results of the current in vitro corrosion studies are compared to 52 week small animal studies to develop predictive models for designing future biomedical devices.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

In this study, we focus on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the Auto MPG dataset, a popular dataset that contains information about various car models and their fuel efficiency. The objective of this research is to explore the application of PCA for dimensionality reduction in the context of the Auto MPG dataset. PCA works by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. By selecting a subset of these components, we can retain the most informative aspects of the data while reducing its dimensionality. Through the application of PCA to the Auto MPG dataset, we aim to achieve two primary outcomes. Firstly, we aim to identify the most influential features that contribute significantly to the variation in fuel efficiency across different car models. Secondly, we seek to determine the optimal number of principal components to retain, striking a balance between dimensionality reduction and preserving the information necessary for accurate analysis. By implementing PCA and evaluating its performance on the Auto MPG dataset, we hope to provide insights into the potential benefits of dimensionality reduction techniques for automotive data analysis. The findings of this study could have implications for enhancing fuel efficiency, understanding the key factors affecting it, and improving decision-making processes related to automobile design and engineering.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}
{"title": "Transformational Challenge Reactor – On the Application of Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) Techniques to the Conception of Nuclear Core", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are radically changing the way objects are designed and manufactured. They allow building by deposition and solidification of material layer by layer, enabling the possibility to create simple and complex features alike, almost seamlessly. Generally, the design optimization process requires to define objectives, design variables and constraints. Additive manufacturing does not challenge this process per se but does allow designers to completely redefine the constraints space as the ones originating from fabrication can be considerably relaxed compared to more “traditional” manufacturing. Thus, design optimization becomes naturally far more responsive to the actual physics being solved and considerably less influenced by fabrication limitations, leading to dramatically different designs. To take advantage of these new opportunities, so-called Designing for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) techniques are emerging. Development of design techniques specifically tailored for additive manufacturing is warranted because, considering AM, the design space is typically considerably larger than with traditional manufacturing. The ability to explore the design space efficiently is of paramount importance for designers. This study proposes to investigate and apply some of these DfAM techniques to the conception of nuclear core. The goal being to assess if these new methods can be applied to core design and if core design could benefits from additive manufacturing technologies. After a brief investigation on the pertinence of some DfAM techniques for core design, algorithms are proposed and a workflow is established to carry neutronics and steady-state thermal-hydraulics analyses. To diminish the work load, the workflow has been automated using python modules. These modules allow the rapid creation of input files, post-treatment of output files and visualization. To test the pertinence of the proposed workflow, three test cases have been investigated: a research and test reactor, a micro-reactor and a space propulsion reactor. These test cases offered a variety of objectives, constraints and operating conditions. It is observed that the proposed workflow is capable of converging quickly and efficiently to valid design solutions. It is then concluded that DfAM techniques can be applied to core design.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
{"title": "Designing solvent systems using self-evolving solubility databases and graph neural networks", "abstract": "Designing solvent systems is key to achieving the facile synthesis and separation of desired products from chemical processes, so many machine learning models have been developed to predict solubilities. However, breakthroughs are needed to address deficiencies in the model's predictive accuracy and generalizability; this can be addressed by expanding and integrating experimental and computational solubility databases. To maximize predictive accuracy, these two databases should not be trained separately, and they should not be simply combined without reconciling the discrepancies from different magnitudes of errors and uncertainties. Here, we introduce self-evolving solubility databases and graph neural networks developed through semi-supervised self-training approaches. Solubilities from quantum-mechanical calculations are referred to during semi-supervised learning, but they are not directly added to the experimental database. Dataset augmentation is performed from 11 637 experimental solubilities to >900 000 data points in the integrated database, while correcting for the discrepancies between experiment and computation. Our model was successfully applied to study solvent selection in organic reactions and separation processes. The accuracy (mean absolute error around 0.2 kcal mol−1 for the test set) is quantitatively useful in exploring Linear Free Energy Relationships between reaction rates and solvation free energies for 11 organic reactions. Our model also accurately predicted the partition coefficients of lignin-derived monomers and drug-like molecules. While there is room for expanding solubility predictions to transition states, radicals, charged species, and organometallic complexes, this approach will be attractive to predictive chemistry areas where experimental, computational, and other heterogeneous data should be combined.", "label": 1}

The three new materials, graphene, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes, can be called \"nanocarbon.\" Like graphite, they are composed entirely of sp2 orbitals, but fullerenes contain 12 pentagons and have some sp3 character. They correspond to nanoplates, nanofibers and nanoparticles, respectively. Rolling up graphene into the smallest possible tube makes a single-walled carbon nanotube, and curling it up into the smallest possible sphere makes a fullerene. These nanomaterials have no bulk equivalents, discounting the fact that graphite is made up of endlessly repeating stacks of graphene. Carbon nanotubes can be commercially exploited by embedding them in a matrix to form some kind of composite. Additionally, the graphene lamellae stacked to make bulk graphite were known from the ease of their detachment to be only weakly bound to each other. Individual sheets of graphene can actually be peeled off graphite using adhesive tape. Alternatively, a crystal of silicon carbide can be heated under vacuum to 1300°C; the silicon evaporates and the remaining carbon slowly reorganizes to form some graphene. The full potential of their remarkable properties, especially electronic ones, in devices will, however, have to await the development of viable nano-object manipulation technologies.

{"title": "AI4ESP: Process Discovery through Assimilation of Complex Geochemical Datasets", "abstract": "assay programs consisted of monitoring hydrogen evolution as a function of temperature. This project also incorporated theoretical methods to help select candidate materials families for testing. The Virtual High Throughput Screening served as a virtual laboratory, calculating structures and their properties. First Principles calculations were applied to various systems to examine hydrogen storage reaction pathways and the associated thermodynamics. The experimental program began with the validation of the MT assay tool with NaAlH4/0.02 mole Ti, the state of the art hydrogen storage system given by decomposition of sodium alanate to sodium hydride, aluminum metal, and hydrogen. Once certified, a combinatorial 21-point study of the NaAlH4 LiAlH4Mg(AlH4)2 phase diagram was investigated with the MT assay. Stability proved to be a problem as many of the materials decomposed during synthesis, altering the expected assay results. This resulted in repeating the entire experiment with a mild milling approach, which only temporarily increased capacity. NaAlH4 was the best performer in both studies and no new mixed alanates were observed, a result consistent with the VHTS. Powder XRD suggested that the reverse reaction, the regeneration of the alanate from alkali hydride, Al and hydrogen, was hampering reversibility. The reverse reaction was then studied for the same phase diagram, starting with LiH, NaH, and MgH2, and Al. The study was extended to phase diagrams including KH and CaH2 as well. The observed hydrogen storage capacity in the Al hexahydrides was less than 4 wt. %, well short of DOE targets. The HT assay came on line and after certification with studies on NaAlH4, was first applied to the LiNH2 - LiBH4 - MgH2 phase diagram. The 60-point study elucidated trends within the system locating an optimum material of 0.6 LiNH2 0.3 MgH2 0.1 LiBH4 that stored about 4 wt. % H2 reversibly and operated below 220 Â°C. Also present was the phase Li4(NH2)3BH4, which had been discovered in the LiNH2 -LiBH4 system. This new ternary formulation performed much better than the well-known 2 LiNH2MgH2 system by 50 Â°C in the HT assay. The Li4(NH2)3BH4 is a low melting ionic liquid under our test conditions and facilitates the phase transformations required in the hydrogen storage reaction, which no longer relies on a higher energy solid state reaction pathway. Further study showed that the 0.6 LiNH2 0.3 MgH2 0.1 LiBH4 formulation was very stable with respect to ammonia and diborane desorption, the observed desorption was from hydrogen. This result could not have been anticipated and was made possible by the efficiency of HT combinatorial methods. Investigation of the analogous LiNH2 LiBH4 CaH2 phase diagram revealed new reversible hydrogen storage materials 0.625 LiBH4 + 0.375 CaH2 and 0.375 LiNH2 + 0.25 LiBH4 + 0.375 CaH2 operating at 1 wt. % reversible hydrogen below 175 Â°C. Powder x-ray diffraction revealed a new structure for the spent materials which had not been previously observed. While the storage capacity was not impressive, an important aspect is that it boron appears to participate in a low temperature reversible reaction. The last major area of study also focused on activating boron-based materials in order to exploit the tremendous gravimetric capacity of LiBH4. A number of LiNH2 LiBH4 transition metal (TM) systems were investigated for the following reasons. No additional leads were discovered in this system. Another major project activity was the assembly of a high throughput synthesis system. The automated synthesizer was set up in a glovebox and was capable of handling liquids and powders and carrying out sealed block syntheses up to 250 Â°C. Unfortunately, the synthesizer could not handle the delivery of the fine powders required fro hydrogen storage applications.

{"title": "Storage of hydrogen in solid-state materials", "abstract": "Global population growth and economic expansion are driving up energy demand, which means we must move away from fossil fuels, which provide 90% of the world's energy today. The finite nature of fossil fuel resources and their substantial contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, which endanger human health and the environment, make this transition imperative. With almost three times the energy density of gasoline, pure, non-toxic, and renewable hydrogen (H2) presents itself as a viable substitute. Its low gravimetric density, however, makes storage difficult. Utilizing materials such as carbon nanotubes and metal-organic frameworks, solid-state H2 storage provides advantages in terms of efficiency and safety at room temperature and pressure. The United States Department of Energy (US DOE) states that optimal hydride-based H2 storage systems should have certain volumetric and gravimetric capabilities with little cycle degradation. Solid-state H2 storage requires the synthesis of affordable metal hydrides with good absorption/desorption characteristics, a large storage capacity, and stability.

Several workflows make thereby use of the same sequence of working processes: a) the initial sampling and analysis that results in experimental data; b) experimental data is subsequently preprocessed which leads to specific datasets; c) the datasets can then –according to their specific focus- be used in the direction of quantitative (target) analysis, compound recognition (by suspects screening), compound finding (by hidden target screening) or the identification of unknowns.

This data-centric approach is much more efficient and practical than the laborious experimental measurements when encountered a daunting number of polymer structures. Various ML models are demonstrated to perform well for T_{g} prediction. Nevertheless, they are trained on different data sets, using different structure representations, and based on different feature engineering methods. Thus, the critical question arises on selecting a proper ML model to better handle the T_{g} prediction with generalization ability. To provide a fair comparison of different ML techniques and examine the key factors that affect the model performance, we carry out a systematic benchmark study by compiling 79 different ML models and training them on a large and diverse data set. The three major components in setting up an ML model are structure representations, feature representations, and ML algorithms. In terms of polymer structure representation, we consider the polymer monomer, repeat unit, and oligomer with longer chain structure. Based on that feature, representation is calculated, including Morgan fingerprinting with or without substructure frequency, RDKit descriptors, molecular embedding, molecular graph, etc. Afterward, the obtained feature input is trained using different ML algorithms, such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, random forest, support vector machine, LASSO regression, and Gaussian process regression. We evaluate the performance of these ML models using a holdout test set and an extra unlabeled data set from high-throughput molecular dynamics simulation. The ML model's generalization ability on an unlabeled data set is especially focused, and the model's sensitivity to topology and the molecular weight of polymers is also taken into consideration. This benchmark study provides not only a guideline for the T_{g} prediction task but also a useful reference for other polymer informatics tasks.", "label": 1}

These criteria are implemented by validity indices that can be evaluatedoffrom the data set and the given clustering alone without having access to a \"true\" clustering.

{"title": "Glass Composition Constraint Recommendations for Use in Life-Cycle Mission Modeling", "abstract": "The component concentration limits that most influence the predicted Hanford life-cycle HLW glass volume by HTWOS were re-evaluated. It was assumed that additional research and development work in glass formulation and melter testing would be performed to improve the understanding of component effects on the processability and product quality of these HLW glasses. Recommendations were made to better estimate the potential component concentration limits that could be applied today while technology development is underway to best estimate the volume of HLW glass that will eventually be produced at Hanford. The limits for concentrations of P2O5, Bi2O3, and SO3 were evaluated along with the constraint used to avoid nepheline formation in glass. Recommended concentration limits were made based on the current HLW glass property models being used by HTWOS (Vienna et al. 2009). These revised limits are: 1) The current ND should be augmented by the OB limit of OB ≤ 0.575 so that either the normalized silica (NSi) is less that the 62% limit or the OB is below the 0.575 limit. 2) The mass fraction of P2O5 limit should be revised to allow for up to 4.5 wt%, depending on CaO concentrations. 3) A Bi2O3 concentration limit of 7 wt% should be used. 4) The salt accumulation limit of 0.5 wt% SO3 may be increased to 0.6 wt%. Again, these revised limits do not obviate the need for further testing, but make it possible to more accurately predict the impact of that testing on ultimate HLW glass volumes.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}
{"title": "Mapping binary copolymer property space with neural networks", "abstract": "The extremely large number of unique polymer compositions that can be achieved through copolymerisation makes it an attractive strategy for tuning their optoelectronic properties. However, this same attribute also makes it challenging to explore the resulting property space and understand the range of properties that can be realised. In an effort to enable the rapid exploration of this space in the case of binary copolymers, we train a neural network using a tiered data generation strategy to accurately predict the optical and electronic properties of 350 000 binary copolymers that are, in principle, synthesizable from their dihalogen monomers via Yamamoto, or Suzuki–Miyaura and Stille coupling after one-step functionalisation. By extracting general features of this property space that would otherwise be obscured in smaller datasets, we identify simple models that effectively relate the properties of these copolymers to the homopolymers of their constituent monomers, and challenge common ideas behind copolymer design. We find that binary copolymerisation does not appear to allow access to regions of the optoelectronic property space that are not already sampled by the homopolymers, although it conceptually allows for more fine-grained property control. Using the large volume of data available, we test the hypothesis that copolymerisation of ‘donor’ and ‘acceptor’ monomers can result in copolymers with a lower optical gap than their related homopolymers. Overall, despite the prevalence of this concept in the literature, we observe that this phenomenon is relatively rare, and propose conditions that greatly enhance the likelihood of its experimental realisation.", "label": 1}

{"title": "Impact of Vacuum Frying on Color Properties of Fried Snacks", "abstract": "The food industry has utilized atmospheric deep fat frying for several years to transform perishable fruits and vegetables into shelf-stable chips/ crisps with a unique flavor, taste, mouthfeel, and texture. Although the process results in a finished product that consumers widely appreciate for its sensory attributes, it has also been shown to be accompanied by a high intake of fat/oil, loss of nutrients, and the formation of acrylamide, which is deleterious to our bodies. Moreover, the high temperature involved in the frying process causes browning and color deterioration, negatively impacting product quality. With increased consumer awareness of adopting a healthy lifestyle, it has become imperative to develop alternative methods to produce fried products that are superior in terms of their sensory and nutritional value. Vacuum frying technology, along with pretreatments/hybrid technology combinations with microwave (MW), ultrasound, and pulsed electric field (PEF), are innovative approaches for manufacturing healthy low-fat fried products. The processing parameters of vacuum frying, such as frying time, vacuum pressure level, and frying temperature, significantly influence the color attributes of the finished 270product and must be optimized based on the fruit or vegetable being fried. This chapter discusses the vacuum frying process and the hybrid methodologies that have been researched to improve overall frying efficiency and finished product characteristics.

{"title": "Computer Aided Multi-scale Design of SiC-Si3N4 Nanoceramic Composites for High-Temperature Structural Applications", "abstract": "It is estimated that by using better and improved high temperature structural materials, the power generation efficiency of the power plants can be increased by 15% resulting in significant cost savings. One such promising material system for future high-temperature structural applications in power plants is Silicon Carbide-Silicon Nitride (SiC-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4}) nanoceramic matrix composites. The described research work focuses on multiscale simulation-based design of these SiC-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} nanoceramic matrix composites. There were two primary objectives of the research: (1) Development of a multiscale simulation tool and corresponding multiscale analyses of the high-temperature creep and fracture resistance properties of the SiC-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} nanocomposites at nano-, meso- and continuum length- and timescales; and (2) Development of a simulation-based robust design optimization methodology for application to the multiscale simulations to predict the range of the most suitable phase morphologies for the desired high-temperature properties of the SiC-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} nanocomposites. The multiscale simulation tool is based on a combination of molecular dynamics (MD), cohesive finite element method (CFEM), and continuum level modeling for characterizing time-dependent material deformation behavior. The material simulation tool is incorporated in a variable fidelity model management based design optimization framework. Material modeling includes development of an experimental verification framework. Using material models based on multiscaling, it was found using molecular simulations that clustering of the SiC particles near Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} grain boundaries leads to significant nanocomposite strengthening and significant rise in fracture resistance. It was found that a control of grain boundary thicknesses by dispersing non-stoichiometric carbide or nitride phases can lead to reduction in strength however significant rise in fracture strength. The temperature dependent strength and microstructural stability was also significantly depended upon the dispersion of new phases at grain boundaries. The material design framework incorporates high temperature creep and mechanical strength data in order to develop a collaborative multiscale framework of morphology optimization. The work also incorporates a computer aided material design dataset development procedure where a systematic dataset on material properties and morphology correlation could be obtained depending upon a material processing scientist's requirements. Two different aspects covered under this requirement are: (1) performing morphology related analyses at the nanoscale and at the microscale to develop a multiscale material design and analyses capability; (2) linking material behavior analyses with the developed design tool to form a set of material design problems that illustrate the range of material design dataset development that could be performed. Overall, a software based methodology to design microstructure of particle based ceramic nanocomposites has been developed. This methodology has been shown to predict changes in phase morphologies required for achieving optimal balance of conflicting properties such as minimal creep strain rate and high fracture strength at high temperatures. The methodology incorporates complex material models including atomistic approaches. The methodology will be useful to design materials for high temperature applications including those of interest to DoE while significantly reducing cost of expensive experiments.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

The development of TMCs enabling these technologies remains challenged by the need to optimize multiple properties within very large chemical spaces, in which the thirty transition metals can be combined with a virtually infinite number of ligands. In this work, we provide the open tmQMg-L dataset including 30K TMC ligands, which combines large chemical diversity with synthesizability. The charge and metal-coordination mode of the ligands were robustly defined with a novel algorithm based on graph and natural bond orbital theories. The tmQMg-L dataset was leveraged in the automated generation of 1.37M TMCs resulting from all possible combinations between a square planar palladium(II) scaffold and a pool of 50 different ligands. This TMC space was used to benchmark a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) that optimized two properties over a Pareto front; namely the polarizability (alpha) and the HOMO-LUMO gap (epsilon). The MOGA evolved 130 TMC hits with maximal (alpha, epsilon) values in a way that could be easily rationalized by analyzing the nature of the ligands selected. Instead of the traditional mutation and crossover of fragments within a single ligand, this MOGA implemented full-ligand genetic operations acting on all coordination sites, maximizing chemical diversity. Further, we extended this MOGA algorithm with the Pareto-Lighthouse functionality (PL-MOGA), which allows for controlling both the aim and scope of the multiobjective optimization over the Pareto front. In explicit spaces containing billions of TMCs, the PL-MOGA enabled the explainable generation of thousands of novel and highly diverse TMC hits. We believe that the combined use of the tmQMg-L dataset and PL-MOGA algorithm will facilitate the discovery of TMCs with optimal properties within untapped chemical spaces.", "label": 1}

The shape memory alloys (SMAs) have a series of properties much different from the usual metallic materials. Their main characteristic is recovery/returning from plastic deformation by heating, considering that in some cases at temperature changing, the shape modification is reversible. In the case of parts made from SMA, which work in conditions by thermal and mechanical stresses and temperature variations, the resistance evaluation at thermal and mechanical fatigue is absolutely necessary. Like researching domain, regarding thermal and mechanical fatigue behavior, it was selected the shape memory Cu-based alloy. The achieved researches, concerning methodology, investigation equipment, experimental results, allow evaluating and estimating the shape memory properties. Losing the shape memory properties of SMA, in requested conditions, namely amnesia, so to the calculation of fatigue resistance must be taken into account by this fundamental property. The expression of the fatigue state, through losing the memorizing capacity, represents a designing indicator, which ensures the guaranty of properties in fatigue conditions, through applying of fatigue cycles. To determine the fatigue resistance of SMA was necessary specific requests. The properties are guaranteed for a certain number of fatigue cycles.

{"title": "Chemometrics as a Green Analytical Tool", "abstract": "Chemometrics is a very important technique for green analytical chemistry. In this chapter, after describing briefly the history of chemometrics in green chemistry and its application to green analytical chemistry, the complexity of datasets, the design of experiments (DOE) and pre-processing methods, which provide basic knowledge for chemometrics, are outlined. Various methodologies of chemometrics are then introduced, which are classified into unsupervised pattern recognition, such as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), and supervised pattern recognition, such as multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). Finally, some examples of applications of spectroscopy–chemometrics research are described, such as the application of moving window partial least-squares regression (MWPLSR) to in vivo non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose by near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and a Raman imaging study of the aggregation of lycopene in vivo in tomato.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}
{"title": "Diels–Alder Click Chemistry: A Powerful Tool for the Synthesis of Polymeric Materials", "abstract": "This chapter highlights the vital role played by the Diels–Alder (DA) cycloaddition reaction in the design and synthesis of various polymeric materials, ranging from discrete polymers to crosslinked networks. The robust nature of this cycloaddition reaction in assembling discrete polymers with varying skeletal arrangements is covered in sections divided according to the type of architecture. Over the years, this reaction has been employed to synthesize linear and branched polymers through step-growth type polymerization. However, in recent years, the robust nature of the DA reaction has led to its utilization in connecting polymer chains to create complex polymeric architectures in a convergent fashion. Furthermore, this reaction has been widely employed in the fabrication of functional polymeric coatings and crosslinked materials such as hydrogels, as highlighted in some sections. Notably, the reacting components, i.e. the diene and dienophiles, are easy to integrate into polymers and yield coupling products with high efficiency using metal catalyst-free reaction conditions. Examples of such synthetic approaches are highlighted through seminal and recent reports. This chapter aims to familiarize the readers with this powerful synthetic tool, which they can consider in their design of novel polymeric materials for various applications.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

However, a thorough evaluation of the effect of the different experimental parameters of the TDS measurement has not been done yet. Some results of this evaluation are presented here. Secondly, the designed methodology was used to test both lab cast and industrial high strength steels. Industrial materials have complex microstructures which hinder a one-to-one correlation between a TDS peak and a microstructural feature. Therefore, lab cast materials were designed and evaluated by TDS to simulate the main microstructural components of the high strength alloys.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

{"title": "Accelerated Solvent Extraction", "abstract": "Extraction of solid and semisolid samples using liquid solvents is a common practice in nearly every analytical laboratory. Years of empirical testing have resulted in rugged and reproducible methodologies for a wide range of analyte classes. However, recent concerns regarding the volumes of organic solvents used (with the associated human exposure), along with increased purchase and disposal costs, have emphasized the need for more efficient sample extraction methods. In response to these concerns, accelerated solvent extraction (ASE®, Dionex Corporation, Salt Lake City, UT) was introduced. Since its introduction in 1995, ASE has grown rapidly as an accepted alternative to traditional extraction methods. Accelerated solvent extraction takes advantage of the enhanced solubilities that occur as the temperature of a liquid solvent is increased. Increasing the temperature of solvent results in a decrease in viscosity, allowing better penetration of the sample matrix. In addition, analyte diffusion from the sample matrix into the solvent and overall solvent capacity are increased. In traditional Soxhlet extraction, the solvent that comes into contact with the sample has passed through a cooling condenser, and is therefore close to room temperature at the point of contact. The time required to complete Soxhlet extractions ranges from 6 to 48 h. Semi-automated Soxhlet systems that immerse the sample into boiling solvent are available. This increase in the temperature of the contacting solvent shortens the required extraction time to ∼2 h. Using these systems, a further increase in temperature beyond the boiling point of the solvent is not possible due to solvent loss because these systems operate at atmospheric pressure. However, a continued increase in the temperature should continue to enhance the extraction process. This can be accomplished by applying pressure, which maintains the solvent in its liquid state beyond its atmospheric boiling point. This is the theoretical basis for ASE technology and represents the next step in liquid solvent extraction of environmental samples. There are, of course, limits to which raising the temperature is feasible, due to thermal degradation concerns. However, as evidenced by data published to date, there is room to continue raising the temperature, thereby improving the extraction efficiency, without risking analyte degradation in environmental samples. As the extraction efficiency is increased, the time required to perform extractions and the amount of solvent needed is reduced. When performing ASE, a 10-g sample can be extracted in ∼12 min using 12–15 mL of solvent. As the sample size is increased (33 mL volume maximum), the amount of solvent used increases proportionally (45–50 mL maximum), but the total extraction time remains unchanged. The short extraction times and small solvent usage make this technique amenable to automation. Samples loaded into stainless steel extraction vessels (11, 22, or 33 mL internal volume) are extracted sequentially into standard 40- or 60-mL glass collection vials. After extraction, the spent sample remains in the cell, whereas the extract is immediately ready for processing. The system is designed to extract up to 24 samples unattended. Because existing solvent-based extraction methods can be readily transferred to ASE technology, methods development is greatly simplified. Existing sample preparation and postextraction processing steps remain in place because the extracts generated by ASE will be of very nearly the same composition as those generated with the existing solvent-based extraction technique. The large range of polarities and solvent strengths available when using liquid solvents, including solvent mixtures, allows a high degree of flexibility and selectivity when developing methods for new sample matrices.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
{"title": "Comprehensive Thermochemical Benchmark Set of Realistic Closed-Shell Metal Organic Reactions", "abstract": "We introduce the new MOR41 benchmark set consisting of 41 closed-shell organometallic reactions resembling many important chemical transformations commonly used in transition metal chemistry and catalysis. It includes significantly larger molecules than presented in other transition metal test sets and covers a broad range of bonding motifs. Recent progress in linear-scaling coupled cluster theory allowed for the calculation of accurate DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS(def2-TZVPP/def2-QZVPP) reference energies for 3d, 4d, 5d-transition metal compounds with up to 120 atoms. Furthermore, 41 density functionals, including seven GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 14 hybrid functionals, and 17 double-hybrid functionals combined with two different London dispersion corrections, are benchmarked with respect to their performance for the newly compiled MOR41 reaction energies. A few wave function-based post-HF methods as, e.g., MP2 or RPA with similar computational demands are also tested and in total, 90 methods were considered. The double-hybrid functional PWPB95-D3(BJ) outperformed all other assessed methods with an MAD of 1.9 kcal/mol, followed by the hybrids ωB97X-V (2.2 kcal/mol) and mPW1B95-D3(BJ) (2.4 kcal/mol). The popular PBE0-D3(BJ) hybrid also performs well (2.8 kcal/mol). Within the meta-GGA class, the recently published SCAN-D3(BJ) functional as well as TPSS-D3(BJ) perform best (MAD of 3.2 and 3.3 kcal/mol, respectively). Many popular methods like BP86-D3(BJ) (4.9 kcal/mol) or B3LYP-D3(BJ) (4.9 kcal/mol) provide significantly worse reaction energies and are not recommended for organometallic thermochemistry considering the availability of better methods with the same computational cost. The results regarding the performance of different functional approximations are consistent with conclusions from previous main-group thermochemistry benchmark studies.", "label": 1}

{"title": "The quantum trajectory sensing problem and its solution", "abstract": "The quantum trajectory sensing problem seeks quantum sensor states which enable the trajectories of incident particles to be distinguished using a single measurement. For an n-qubit sensor state to unambiguously discriminate a set of trajectories with a single projective measurement, all post-trajectory output states must be mutually orthogonal; therefore, the 2^n state coefficients must satisfy a system of constraints which is typically very large. Given that this system is generally challenging to solve directly, we introduce a group-theoretic framework which simplifies the criteria for sensor states and exponentially reduces the number of equations and variables involved when the trajectories obey certain symmetries. These simplified criteria yield general families of trajectory sensor states and provide bounds on the particle–sensor interaction strength required for perfect one-shot trajectory discrimination. Furthermore, we establish a link between trajectory sensing and quantum error correction, recognizing their common motivation to identify perturbations using projective measurements. Our sensor states in fact form novel quantum codes, and conversely, a number of familiar stabilizer codes (such as toric codes) also provide trajectory sensing capabilities. This connection enables noise-resilient trajectory sensing through the concatenation of sensor states with quantum error-correcting codes.", "label": 1}
{"title": "Electrically Conducting Plastics: Revising the History of Conjugated Organic Polymers", "abstract": "The discovery that the conductivity of conjugated organic polymers can be controlled through oxidation or reduction led to materials combining the electronic properties of metals with the weight and density of plastics.

While these studies produced the most dramatic results, investigations of electrically conductive conjugated polymers date back to the early 1960s, particularly with the work of Donald Weiss on polypyrrole, as well as that of René Buvet and Marcel Jozefowicz on polyaniline. That these previous studies are overlooked in the history of conjugated polymers is unfortunate and thus many in the field are unaware of these previous contributions.

{"title": "Proteins and Their Ligands: Their Importance and How to Crystallize Them", "abstract": "The importance of structural biology has been highlighted in the past few years not only as part of drug discovery programs in the pharmaceutical industry but also by structural genomics programs.

In principle three techniques exist to determine a protein structure, namely X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy (EM). X-ray crystallography contributes over 90 % of all structures in the protein data bank (PDB) and emphasis the importance of this technique. Crystallization of a protein is a tedious route and although a lot of knowledge about crystallization has been gained in the last decades, one still cannot predict the outcome.

Comparing the results of several experiments in natural seawater and artificial seawater acidified to pH 6.3, it may be hypothesised that, in the case of aluminium brass, one of the mechanisms of the action of biofilm on corrosion is the occurrence of acidification of the metal-biofilm interface. In fact, noticeable differences have been found in the corrosion current density values (up to 2μA cm-2) and in the surface morphology of specimens exposed to natural seawater — which proved more aggressive — compared with the results observed in artificial seawater at the same pH (8.3). On the other hand, there were significant similarities with the results obtained from tests using acidified artificial seawater. Potentiodynamic cathodic curves, free corrosion potential measurements and electrochemical measurements for evaluating the polarisation resistance, were carried out on all the samples. Chemical analyses and analysis of the surface morphology were also conducted.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
{"title": "Heavy Metal Pollution and Medicinal Plants", "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities like the unbalanced use of fertilizers, agricultural chemicals like pesticides, and other industrial activities such as drilling, steelmaking, and burning of fossil fuels as well as the use of untreated wastewater from different industries have resulted in soil pollution with heavy metals (HMs). This important ecological restriction has contributed to reduced agricultural production and decreased nutritional quality due to the bioaccumulation of HMs in the plant body. Medicinal plants are being recommended for alternative products with non-food staple crops in potentially toxic elements contaminated environments. Despite their ability to bioaccumulate higher concentrations of HMs in their plant body, the plant parts used for medicinal purposes are transferring HMs into the food chain and have ultimately resulted in biomagnification through bioaccumulation in the food chain. Under HM stress, there is an increased production of reactive oxygen species, which pose oxidative stress on the membranous organelles, resulting in lipid peroxidation, protein denaturation, and nucleic acids destruction, damaging their structure and function and ultimately disrupting various metabolic processes involved in growth and development. In order to combat oxidative stress, medicinal plants activate the antioxidant system, which includes the secretion of enzymatic (ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase) and non-enzymatic (carotenoids, glutamate, ascorbate, phenolics, or tocopherol) antioxidants.

{"title": "Biodegradation Behavior of Textiles Impregnated with Ag and TiO2 Nanoparticles in Soil", "abstract": "Increasing global consumption of textile goods poses serious environmental problems that are present throughout the products life-cycles. With a trend of Fast Fashion, clothes became consuming goods that are discarded in huge amounts into landfills where they rot generating undesirable gases which contribute to environmental pollution and greenhouse effect. A large-scale centralized composting is a possible alternative to harmful landfilling. It is well known that different textile fibers exhibit diverse biodegradation behavior. Unlike most of the synthetic fibers, natural and particularly cellulosic fibers are prone to biodegradation. However, the finishing and thus, the presence of different chemicals on fiber surfaces may affect their biodegradation performance. Recent progress in the production of textiles impregnated with different metal and metal oxide nanoparticles is more oriented toward end-use achievements than on their environmental and health safety impacts. Despite the urgency to establish their environmental risk assessment, there are only few papers dealing with biodegradation behavior of such textile nanocomposites under terrestrial conditions. Therefore, this chapter is aimed to provide an insight into these results and to stress the necessity of extended research in this field taking into consideration that various characteristics of nanoparticles are relevant for their biodegradation behavior.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

Afterward, the dyes are tested as active media of tunable lasers under transversal pumping. The recorded laser efficiencies and photostabilities are correlated with the registered photophysical properties identifying the main structural guidelines and photonic parameters, which rule the laser bands’ position, intensity, and stability. As a result, we provide a comparative dataset of the laser performance, not available hitherto.

All complexes are closed-shell, with a formal charge in the range {+1, 0, -1}e. The tmQM data set provides the Cartesian coordinates of all metal complexes optimized at the GFN2-xTB level, and their molecular size, stoichiometry, and metal node degree. The quantum properties were computed at the DFT(TPSSh-D3BJ/def2-SVP) level and include the electronic and dispersion energies, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies, HOMO/LUMO gap, dipole moment, and natural charge of the metal center; GFN2-xTB polarizabilities are also provided. Pairwise representations showed the low correlation between these properties, providing nearly continuous maps with unusual regions of the chemical space, for example, complexes combining large polarizabilities with wide HOMO/LUMO gaps and complexes combining low-energy HOMO orbitals with electron-rich metal centers. The tmQM data set can be exploited in the data-driven discovery of new metal complexes, including predictive models based on machine learning.

Unirradiated datasets developed both by ORNL and previously within literature using Charpy V-notch specimens to determine the ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT) showed key findings including (i) increasing Al and/or Cr content can raise the DBTT of FeCrAl alloys, (ii) DBTT values can typically reside at or above room temperature for FeCrAl alloys, and (iii) grain size and residual strain can have an effect on the fracture properties. These results suggest that the fracture toughness of FeCrAl alloys may be a factor in its deployment for nuclear power applications, but no studies have been completed prior regarding the DBTT or fracture toughness of FeCrAl alloys after neutron irradiation, especially for the leaner Cr content alloys currently under investigation as candidate alloys for light water reactor (LWR) cladding. Taken in isolation, embrittlement of a cladding alloy during service has no bearing on possible licensure. Hydriding of zirconium cladding alloys is well understood to result in significant embrittlement. Furthermore, mechanical failure of irradiated cladding containing fuel pellets occurs at far higher stresses than defueled cladding samples because the presence of the fuel toughens the fuel rod. Despite this absence of direct relevance to licensure, radiation embrittlement is a fundamental structure-property evolution that should be understood to guide further development of FeCrAl alloys. Licensure of FeCrAl incorporates far more complex system behaviors that will not be possible until larger quantities of fueled irradiated rodlets are available.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

All glasses were fabricated in the laboratory and subsequently exposed to six different cooling treatments. The cooling treatments consisted of three 'stepped' profiles and their corresponding 'smooth' profiles. Included in the cooling treatment was the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) canister centerline cooling (CCC) profile in addition to a 'faster' and a 'slower' total cooling line. After quenching and heat treating, x-ray diffraction confirmed the type and amount of any resultant crystallization. The target compositions were shown to be consistent with the measured compositions. Two quenched glasses and several treated glasses exhibited minor amounts of spinel and spinel-like phases. Nepheline was not observed in any of the quenched glasses but was observed in many of the treated glasses. The amount of nepheline ranged from approximately 2wt% to 30wt% for samples cooled over shorter times and longer times respectively. Differences were observed in the amount of nepheline crystallization after smooth and stepped cooling and increased with total cooling time. In some glasses, nepheline crystallization appeared to be directly proportional to total cooling time while the total amount of nepheline crystallization varied, suggesting that the nepheline crystallization rate was independent of (or at least faster than) cooling rate but, varied depending on the glass composition. On the contrary, in another glass, nepheline crystallization appeared to be inversely proportional to cooling rate. The high alumina glasses, predicted to form nepheline according to the ND, did not precipitate nepheline. Additionally, analysis from different regions of treated glasses indicated that nepheline nucleation and growth occurs at the glass/crucible and glass/atmosphere interfaces. Furthermore, the measured amount of non-nepheline phases appeared independent of the sampling region. It is postulated that crucible-scale methods used to heat treat HLW glass, such as the CCC method, artificially induce nepheline formation in the glass. The results of this study suggest nepheline kinetics can vary significantly depending on glass composition and, more importantly, glasses fabricated using current DWPF conditions are potentially susceptible to the impact of nepheline kinetics. This report summarizes the supporting research and provides the basis for continued research on nepheline kinetics and its effects on HLW glasses.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
{"title": "Mechanical and Thermophysical Properties of 3D-Printed SiC-FY20", "abstract": "In the Transformational Challenge Reactor (TCR), the fuel blocks consist of an additively-manufactured silicon carbide (SiC) matrix and uranium nitride tristructural isotropic (UN TRISO) fuel particles, which are stacked to form fuel columns. The SiC matrix is manufactured using binderjet 3D printing followed by loading the TRISO fuel particles and the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process. Because the fuel matrix is a primary component of the TCR core and its response to mechanical and thermal loads during operation is one of the most influential factors on the integrity of TCR core, testing and evaluation have focused on producing mechanical and thermophysical properties data for the binderjet/CVI SiC. Mechanical and thermophysical properties were measured from various types of specimens printed for two or three orientations, which included equibiaxial flexural failure strength, elastic constants, thermal diffusivity and conductivity, density, and the coefficient of thermal expansion. Flexural failure strength datasets showed similar Weibull distributions regardless of sample variants including different orientations. The mean failure strengths of the 3D-printed SiC variants were in the range of 286–306 MPa, which are 22–27% lower than that of the CVD SiC. Thermophysical test results showed that specific heat and thermal expansion are not sensitive to the build directions of SiC samples, while thermal diffusivity is highly dependent on the build direction and can be correlated to the anisotropic character of the 3D-printed SiC. This report also includes discussions on the uniaxial tensile properties of the as-printed SiC before CVI and on ongoing efforts for irradiation effects studies.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

But with the advent of handy digital cameras and improvement in the image capturing and processing systems, the age-old manual classification methods have been fast replaced by the automatic classification techniques supported by computer vision based techniques. The thermal imaging is one of the popular non-destructive methodology applied to classify fruits. In the automatic classification of images machine learning techniques are being replaced by deep learning techniques because of their higher classification accuracy rates. In the present research work, a thermal image dataset has been created for eleven different varieties of fruits and classified using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN). In our work, instead of building and training a CNN from start, we have utilized a pre-built and pre-trained network via transfer learning. Parameters like sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, precision and accuracy of CNN for transfer learning of fruit classification have been tested. The results reveal that our classification system has Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy as 96.54% and 100% respectively with the training time of 9.21 minutes using SqueezeNet model.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}
{"title": "A look at the density functional theory zoo with the advanced GMTKN55 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions", "abstract": "We present the GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions. Compared to its popular predecessor GMTKN30 [Goerigk and Grimme J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2011, 7, 291], it allows assessment across a larger variety of chemical problems—with 13 new benchmark sets being presented for the first time—and it also provides reference values of significantly higher quality for most sets. GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community via a dedicated website. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of better reference values, and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems, including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are ωB97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and ωB97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies.", "label": 1}

{"title": "Representation Theory of Groups", "abstract": "Representation theory is an important pillar of the group theory. As we shall see soon, a word \"representation\" and its definition sound a bit daunting. To be short, however, we need \"numbers\" or \"matrices\" to do a mathematical calculation. Therefore, we may think of the representation as merely numbers and matrices. Individual representations have their dimension. If that dimension is one, we treat a representation as a number (real or complex). If the dimension is two or more, we are going to deal with matrices; in the case of the n-dimension, it is a (n, n) square matrix. In this chapter we focus on the representation theory of finite groups. In this case, we have an important theorem stating that a representation of any finite group can be converted to a unitary representation by a similarity transformation. That is, group elements of a finite group are represented by a unitary matrix. According to the dimension of the representation, we have the same number of basis vectors. Bearing these things firmly in mind, we can pretty easily understand this important notion of representation.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

Photoluminescence (PL) investigations, however, have revealed that across the polytypes: 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC, excitation wavelength–dependent PL is observed for larger sizes but deviates for sizes smaller than approximately 3 nm, thus exhibiting a dual-feature in the PL spectra. Additionally, nanostructures of varying polytypes and bandgaps exhibit strikingly similar PL emission centered at approximately 450 nm. At this wavelength, 3C-SiC emission is above the bulk bandgap as expected of quantum size effects, but for 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC the emissions are below bandgap. 4H-SiC is a suitable polytype to study these effects.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

It must achieve high accuracy within the constraints of molecular mechanics' (MM) limited functional forms, which offers high computational efficiency. With the rapid expansion of synthetically accessible chemical space, traditional look-up table approaches face significant challenges. In this study, we address this issue using a modern data-driven approach, developing ByteFF, an Amber-compatible force field for drug-like molecules. To create ByteFF, we generated an expansive and highly diverse molecular dataset at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/DZVP level of theory. This dataset includes 2.4 million optimized molecular fragment geometries with analytical Hessian matrices, along with 3.2 million torsion profiles. We then trained an edge-augmented, symmetry-preserving molecular graph neural network (GNN) on this dataset, employing a carefully optimized training strategy. Our model predicts all bonded and non-bonded MM force field parameters for drug-like molecules simultaneously across a broad chemical space. ByteFF demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, excelling in predicting relaxed geometries, torsional energy profiles, and conformational energies and forces. Its exceptional accuracy and expansive chemical space coverage make ByteFF a valuable tool for multiple stages of computational drug discovery.", "label": 1}

In this work, we examined NO2 pair adsorption behaviour over the (MgO)9 and (CaO)9 surface clusters by considering NO2 bind on cations forming nitrite and NO2 binds on anions producing nitrates. In addition, vibrational spectra have been computed by means of the B3LYP hybrid density functional in order to interpret the experiments [J. Phys. Chem. B 2002, 106, 6358] particularly, regarding a transient 1225 cm-1 absorption during accumulation of NO2 in MgO supported BaO. The degree of generality of results was tested by comparing (NO2)x (MO)9 for x=1,2 and M=Mg, Ca. Finger prints are produced for the single bidentate M2+-[ONO]--M2+ surface nitrite ion. A novel single monodentate [Ocluster - NO2]2- ion and the chemisorbed Nitrite/Nitrate ion pair, i.e., M2+-[ONO]--M2+ + [Ocluster -NO2]-. The results showed, the novel monodentate [Ocluster - NO2]2-, to be responsible for the experimentally observed 1225 cm-1 absorption, being a transient towards surface nitrate rather than nitrite formation. This result is consistent with a mechanistic DFT study concerning the initial loading of NO2 in BaO. Furthermore, our results show the computed in stability for a single adsorbed Nitrite is 0.36 eV and (1.66 eV) for Mg9O9 and (Ca9O9), while, pairs adsorption displays a 2.82 eV and (3.64 eV) stability.

Commonly used approaches such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) frequently fail for this task due to deficiencies that are well recognized. However, for high-fidelity approaches, creating large datasets of energies and forces for reactive processes to train machine learning interatomic potentials or force fields is daunting. For example, the use of the unrestricted coupled cluster level of theory has previously been seen as unfeasible due to high computational costs, the lack of analytical gradients in many computational codes, and additional challenges such as constructing suitable basis set corrections for forces. In this work, we develop new methods and workflows to overcome the challenges inherent to automating unrestricted coupled cluster calculations. Using these advancements, we create a dataset of gas-phase reactions containing energies and forces for 3119 different organic molecules configurations calculated at the gold-standard level of unrestricted CCSD(T) (coupled cluster singles doubles and perturbative triples). With this dataset, we provide an analysis of the differences between the density functional and unrestricted CCSD(T) descriptions. We develop a transferable machine learning interatomic potential for gas-phase reactions, trained on unrestricted CCSD(T) data, and demonstrate the advantages of transitioning away from DFT data.

Generation, growth, and collapse of cavitation are repeated with the particles of titanium oxide and platinum. Because the cavitation has an extremely high collapse pressure, the surface of the titanium oxide particles is processed by the microjets of cavitation in a reactor comprising the ejector nozzle. In the multifunction cavitation, ultrasonic irradiation of a waterjet during floating cavitation was used to generate microjets with hot spots. Hot working can be performed at the nanoscale on a material surface using this MFC process, resulting in morphological changes and variations in the surface electrochemical characteristics. The fundamental characteristics of multifunction cavitation were investigated theoretically and experimentally. Furthermore, the additional nozzle was put on the ejector nozzle in order to increase the temperature and pressure of bubble and the mechanism was clarified. The quantities of hydrogen and oxygen generated from titanium dioxide particles treated by multifunction cavitation in response to UV and visible light irradiation were remarkably increased compared to the amounts produced by particles treated by WJC processing. In this chapter, the methods and their results of processing particles by cavitation are introduced.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

{"title": "OPTICAL RESPONSES AT THE NANOPARTICLE-BIOLOGICAL INTERFACE WITH AN INTRODUCTION TO OPTICAL MICROSOCOPY IN UNDERGRADUATE ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY CURRICULUM", "abstract": "one of its LSPR wavelengths under polarized illumination, the optical behavior varies in a sinusoidal fashion. A dimer of nanorods exhibits optical behavior quite similar to a nanorod, except the LSPR maxima are shifted and broader. Under differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, a pair of nanorods separated by a distance below the diffraction limit can be distinguished from a single nanorod due to its optical behavior upon rotation. Dark field microscopy is unable to distinguish the two geometries. For the second set of experiments, the optical behavior of single gold nanorods at non-plasmonic wavelengths was investigated. The same nanorod was rotated with respect to a polarized light source under DIC, dark field, and polarized light microscopy. DIC microscopy was found to produce diffraction pattern peaks at non-plasmonic wavelengths, which could be altered by adjusting the setting of the polarizer. In the third set of experiments, the optical behavior of a single gold dumbbell and several simple dumbbell geometries were investigated with microscopy and simulations. The single dumbbell displayed behavior quite similar to that of a nanorod, but dumbbells exhibit a shift in both LSPR wavebands. Moreover, the shape of dumbbell particles allows them to interlock with one another quite easily. The dimers that form as a result display optical behavior that differs from what has been previously reported about nanorod dimers. Simulated surface charge density patterns reveal that hybridization of LSPR modes occurs readily along the lobes of individual dumbbells in some situations. A pentamer of dumbbells also displays hybridization of modes, and “hot spots” are observed at junctions between pairings of dumbbells. In the final set of experiments, the assembly behavior of nanoparticles in solution was observed in real time. In general, large assemblies of nanoparticles display backbone-like rigidity, but an interesting variety of movements is permitted within the larger structures.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

{"title": "VARIABILITY OF KD VALUES IN CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS AND SEDIMENTS", "abstract": "Measured distribution coefficients (K{sub d} values) for environmental contaminants provide input data for performance assessments (PA) that evaluate physical and chemical phenomena for release of radionuclides from wasteforms, degradation of engineered components and subsequent transport of radionuclides through environmental media. Research efforts at SRNL to study the effects of formulation and curing variability on the physiochemical properties of the saltstone wasteform produced at the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF) are ongoing and provide information for the PA and Saltstone Operations. Furthermore, the range and distribution of plutonium K{sub d} values in soils is not known. Knowledge of these parameters is needed to provide guidance for stochastic modeling in the PA. Under the current SRS liquid waste processing system, supernate from F & H Tank Farm tanks is processed to remove actinides and fission products, resulting in a low-curie Decontaminated Salt Solution (DSS). At the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF), DSS is mixed with premix, comprised of blast furnace slag (BFS), Class F fly ash (FA), and portland cement (OPC) to form a grout mixture. The fresh grout is subsequently placed in SDF vaults where it cures through hydration reactions to produce saltstone, a hardened monolithic waste form. Variation in saltstone composition and cure conditions of grout can affect the saltstone's physiochemical properties. Variations in properties may originate from variables in DSS, premix, and water to premix ratio, grout mixing, placing, and curing conditions including time and temperature (Harbour et al. 2007; Harbour et al. 2009). There are no previous studies reported in the literature regarding the range and distribution of K{sub d} values in cementitious materials. Presently, the Savannah River Site (SRS) estimate ranges and distributions of K{sub d} values based on measurements of K{sub d} values made in sandy SRS sediments (Kaplan 2010). The actual cementitious material K{sub d} values and solubility values differ from the sandy sediments. The K{sub d} value range and distribution currently used in the PA are estimated to range between 0.25*K{sub d} and 1.75*K{sub d}, where the minimum and maximum values of the ranges reflect the 95% confidence level for the mean K{sub d} value (Kaplan 2010). The objective of the research with cementitious materials was to measure the range and distribution of a monovalent (Cs) and I{sup -} (anion), divalent (Sr), and trivalent (Eu) ions for a variety of laboratory-prepared saltstone surrogate samples to establish a K{sub d} range other than that which is presently used in the PA. It has been observed in laboratory samples that cure temperature profiles can affect properties such as heat of hydration, permeability, porosity, compressive strength, and set time (Harbour et al. 2009). The intent was to identify a range and distribution that could be used by stochastic modelers for the PA. Furthermore, the intent was to replace the arbitrarily selected distributions based on geological sandy sediments and to base it on actual cementitious materials. The scope of this study did not include understanding saltstone sorption mechanisms responsible for increasing or decreasing sorption. Similar to the work with cementitious materials, the purpose of the Pu sediment K{sub d} dataset was not to attempt to understand through statistics how to better understand Pu sorption to sediments or to lower Pu K{sub d} variance. The sediment Pu K{sub d} data is included in this study because it is a key risk driver for the PAs on the SRS, and there is presently no direct studies of Pu variability in SRS soils. Instead the distribution of Pu sediment K{sub d} values was assumed to be similar to other cations, as presented by Kaplan (2010).", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

First, a classification model was created to discriminate between injected and non-injected tuna samples. Then, a second classification model was developed to discriminate between non-injected and each water and additives treatment used. The results were promising, showing both models good results in the validation dataset. The first model, with 8 latent variables (LV), had an error-rate of 0.08 and an accuracy value of 0.93. It showed a good discrimination between injected and non-injected samples. The second model, with 10 LV, presented an error rate of 0.15 and an accuracy of 0.88. The discrimination between treatments was good even when protein hydrolysate solutions were used (sensitivity = 0.81; specificity = 0.99; precision = 0.87), a case which is typically hard to detect with accurate destructive analysis.

In general, materials property prediction are regression problems with a vector-based input material representation. While fully connected layers have been widely used in deep neural networks to predict materials properties, simply adding more and more layers to create a deep model often degrades their performance due to the vanishing gradient problem, thereby limiting usage. In this paper, we study and propose architectural principles for building deep regression neural networks comprising fully connected layers with numerical vectors that bypass manual feature engineering. We introduce a novel deep regression neural network with branched residual learning, BRNet, consisting of branching of layers to maximize variation of features learned from the input or previous layer and places skip connections after each layer to minimize the information loss due to vanishing gradient. We perform BRNet model training for inorganic material properties using numerical vectors representing the elemental fractions of the compositions of the respective materials and compare its performance against other traditional ML and DL techniques, including ElemNet and IRNet. Using multiple datasets (such as OQMD, MP, JARVIS) for training and testing, we show that BRNet models are significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art ML methods and DL models for all data sizes by using only raw elemental fractions as input. We also show that BRNet's branched residual learning requires fewer parameters and leads to better convergence during the training phase than other neural networks, thus resulting in faster model training.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

Thus, pKa affects chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties. Multiple proprietary software packages exist for the prediction of pKa, but to the best of our knowledge no free and open-source programs exist for this purpose. Using a freely available data set and three machine learning approaches, we developed open-source models for pKa prediction. Methods: The experimental strongest acidic and strongest basic pKa values in water for 7912 chemicals were obtained from DataWarrior, a freely available software package. Chemical structures were curated and standardized for quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling using KNIME, and a subset comprising 79% of the initial set was used for modeling. To evaluate different approaches to modeling, several datasets were constructed based on different processing of chemical structures with acidic and/or basic pKas. Continuous molecular descriptors, binary fingerprints, and fragment counts were generated using PaDEL, and pKa prediction models were created using three machine learning methods, (1) support vector machines (SVM) combined with k-nearest neighbors (kNN), (2) extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and (3) deep neural networks (DNN). Results: The three methods delivered comparable performances on the training and test sets with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) around 1.5 and a coefficient of determination (R^2) around 0.80. Two commercial pKa predictors from ACD/Labs and ChemAxon were used to benchmark the three best models developed in this work, and performance of our models compared favorably to the commercial products.

{"title": "A quantitative metric for organic radical stability and persistence using thermodynamic and kinetic features", "abstract": "Long-lived organic radicals are promising candidates for the development of high-performance energy solutions such as organic redox batteries, transistors, and light-emitting diodes. However, “stable” organic radicals that remain unreactive for an extended time and that can be stored and handled under ambient conditions are rare. A necessary but not sufficient condition for organic radical stability is the presence of thermodynamic stabilization, such as conjugation with an adjacent π-bond or lone-pair, or hyperconjugation with a σ-bond. However, thermodynamic factors alone do not result in radicals with extended lifetimes: many resonance-stabilized radicals are transient species that exist for less than a millisecond. Kinetic stabilization is also necessary for persistence, such as steric effects that inhibit radical dimerization or reaction with solvent molecules. We describe a quantitative approach to map organic radical stability, using molecular descriptors intended to capture thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. The comparison of an extensive dataset of quantum chemical calculations of organic radicals with experimentally-known stable radical species reveals a region of this feature space where long-lived radicals are located. These descriptors, based upon maximum spin density and buried volume, are combined into a single metric, the radical stability score, that outperforms thermodynamic scales based on bond dissociation enthalpies in identifying remarkably long-lived radicals. This provides an objective and accessible metric for use in future molecular design and optimization campaigns. We demonstrate this approach in identifying Pareto-optimal candidates for stable organic radicals.", "label": 1}

In particular, the potential use of silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) in the biomedical industry as optical contrast agents has garnered attention due to the non-toxicity of silicon, as well as its abundance and low cost. It is therefore prudent to understand factors that effect the PL behavior of these SiNPs in biological media. In this research, hydrogen terminated SiNPs (H-SiNPs) were synthesized using a sol-gel method, suspended in ethanol, then titrated with aqueous acid and base. The resulting behavior was then characterized with Fourier-transform infrared and photoluminescence emission and excitation spectroscopies. It was observed that suspension of red emitting H-SiNPs in ethanol led to a quenching of PL emissions and a reduction of hydrogen termination on their surface. Titration of the ethanol suspension with acid led to a resurgence of the red emissions, while titration with base did not induce any observable PL emissions. Additional modification by warming and resuspension into hexane also led to a brief resurgence of the red emissions in both cases.

{"title": "Combining Melt Electrowriting (MEW) and other Electrospinning-based Technologies with 3D Printing to Manufacture Multiphasic Conductive Scaffold for Tissue Engineering", "abstract": "Tissue engineering (TE) or regenerative medicine is a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary field that aims to develop functional biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue function by combining a scaffold, cells, and biological molecules [1]. Scaffolds play a vital role in controlling cell adhesion, proliferation, and growth which are important factors determining the fate of the cell and its functionality for TE scaffolds. Successful tissue scaffolds which can be fabricated by various methods such as electrospinning, freeze-drying, 3D printing and self-assembly techniques, must have appropriate chemical composition, desired cytocompatibility, mechanical stability, biodegradability, sufficient hydrophilicity, porosity, suitable morphology, and roughness to be considered as ideal substrates for controlling cellular interaction and cell fates [2]. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a three-dimensional network of extracellular macromolecules, such as collagen, enzymes, and glycoproteins, which provide structural and biochemical support to surrounding cells. ECM is the primary factor required in the process of forming a new network of tissue. In addition to a suitable scaffold supporting cellular growth and differentiation, it is also desirable to integrate multiple different cues into any tissue-engineered construct to closely mimic the ECM and recapitulate the tissue's natural microenvironment [3]. The most important scaffold properties and cues to be considered in a TE scaffold design process will be presented. In this article, special attention is given to electrical conductivity, one of the key factors in a successful TE scaffold. The most used materials that increase conductivity of the scaffolds and the processing methods to incorporate them are presented below. Electrospun scaffolds from melt materials are of great interest as potential substrates for TE due to their remarkable fiber size range and porosity density control. Without the need for toxic solvents, they offer a high surface-to-volume ratio with controllable alignment to guide cell growth in the preferred orientation to create physical structures closely similar to the ECM. This review shows the potential of using multiphasic scaffolds with conductive polymers for TE.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}

As the long carbon chains encapsulated in carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the carbon nanowires (CNWs) can be prepared by electrical arc discharge or thermal annealing methods.

Understanding the mechanism of carbyne formation in CNTs not only helps to optimize and control the existing experimental synthesis techniques, also guides the development of novel experimental methods to prepare carbynes under various confinements and device applications. This chapter introduces the atomistic simulations of carbyne formation inside CNTs by using newly developed reactive force fields (dubbed ReaxFFC-S22). The insertion and fusion processes of carbon chains are described in terms of configuration evolution associated with the bond breaking and formation.

Adipic acid was used to introduce carboxyl groups onto the surface of CaCO3 particles. CaCO3 particles double-coated with chitosan-adipic acid (abbreviated as CAC) were prepared through the ionic interaction between the 2 site amino group of chitosan and the carboxyl group of adipic acid. The structure of CAC was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The zeta potential and contact angle of CAC were studied to evaluate particle interfacial properties. FTIR and TGA analyses showed that chitosan and adipic acid on CAC were combined through electrostatic interactions. When the chitosan concentration was more than 5%, the surface of the CaCO3 particles were coated completely. When chitosan was applied at a 9% concentration to make CAC, the zeta potential increased from –27.58 mV for unmodified particles to +13.11 mV for CAC due to the increased positive charge from chitosan. In a similar way, the specific surface area increased from 2.846 m2/g to 4.709 m2/g, the average particle size decreased from 11.21 μm to 7.49 μm, and the contact angle increased from 0° to 87°.

Baseline mechanical and thermophysical properties were measured from the disk specimens printed for different and sizes orientations, which included equibiaxial flexural failure strength, elastic constants, thermal diffusivity and conductivity, density, and the coefficient of thermal expansion. Flexural failure strength datasets showed similar Weibull distributions regardless of sample variants including different orientations. The mean failure strengths of the 3D-printed SiC variants were in the range of 280–310 MPa, which are slightly lower than that of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) SiC. Thermophysical test results showed that specific heat and thermal expansion are not sensitive to the build direction of SiC samples, while thermal conductivity is highly dependent on the build direction and can be correlated to the anisotropic character of the 3D-printed SiC. Neutron irradiation tests were carried out on the 3D-printed 6-mm diameter SiC disk specimens. Irradiation was carried to 2.3 dpa over a temperature range of 360–880°C. No significant degradation in strength was observed in SiC after irradiations in various conditions and with different orientations. Anisotropy that had been observed in the thermal conductivity of 3D-printed SiC prior to irradiation vanished after irradiation as the irradiation defect thermal resistivity accumulated in the material.

Counterfeit documents are increasingly being produced using various means, necessitating expertise in questioned documents and analytical research methods. Non-destructive or quasi-destructive analysis methods are crucial, considering the nature of the examined documents, and these are discussed in this chapter. However, interpreting the spectral information obtained from modern spectrophotometers, which includes data on inks, toners, papers, and other materials in the questioned document, presents a significant challenge due to the sheer volume of data and chemical information involved. This poses a constant need for experts to analyse large datasets and extract meaningful information that can answer court queries and aid in accurate interpretation of outcomes.

The reversibility and dynamic nature of DCC has made prediction of reaction outcome particularly difficult and thus slows the discovery rate of new organic materials. In addition, traditional experimental processes are time-consuming and often rely on serendipity. Here, we present a streamlined hybrid workflow that combines automated high-throughput experimentation, automated data analysis, and computational modelling, to accelerate the discovery process of one particular subclass of molecular organic materials, porous organic cages. We demonstrate how the design and implementation of this workflow aids in the identification of organic cages with desirable properties. The curation of a precursor library of 55 tri- and di-topic aldehyde and amine precursors enabled the experimental screening of 366 imine condensation reactions experimentally, and 1464 hypothetical organic cage outcomes to be computationally modelled. From the screen, 225 cages were identified experimentally using mass spectrometry, 54 of which were cleanly formed as a single topology as determined by both turbidity measurements and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Integration of these characterisation methods into a fully automated Python pipeline, named cagey, led to over a 350-fold decrease in the time required for data analysis.

These include thermophysical properties as well as burst characteristics, oxidation kinetics, possible eutectic interactions, and failure temperatures. These properties can vary among different FeCrAl alloys. Oak Ridge National Laboratory has pursued refined values for the oxidation kinetics of the B136Y FeCrAl alloy (Fe-13Cr-6Al wt %). This investigation included oxidation tests with varying heating rates and end-point temperatures in a steam environment. The rate constant for the low-temperature oxidation kinetics was found to be higher than that for the commercial APMT FeCrAl alloy (Fe-21Cr-5Al-3Mo wt %). Compared with APMT, a 5 times higher rate constant best predicted the entire dataset (root mean square deviation). Based on tests following heating rates comparable with those the cladding would experience during a station blackout, the transition to higher oxidation kinetics occurs at approximately 1,500°C. A parametric study varying the low-temperature FeCrAl oxidation kinetics was conducted for a BWR plant using FeCrAl fuel cladding and channel boxes using the MELCOR code. A range of station blackout severe accident scenarios were simulated for a BWR/4 reactor with Mark I containment. Increasing the FeCrAl low-temperature oxidation rate constant (3 times and 10 times that of the rate constant for APMT) had a negligible impact on the early stages of the accident and minor impacts on the accident progression after the first relocation of the fuel. At temperatures below 1,500°C, increasing the rate constant for APMT by a factor of 10 still resulted in only minor FeCrAl oxidation. In general, the gains afforded by the FeCrAl enhanced ATF concept with respect to accident sequence timing and combustible gas generation are consistent with previous efforts. Compared with the traditional Zircaloy-based cladding and channel box system, the FeCrAl concept could provide a few extra hours of time for operators to take mitigating actions and/or for evacuations to take place. A coolable core geometry is retained longer, enhancing the ability to stabilize an accident. For example, a station blackout was simulated in which cooling water injection was lost 36 hours after shutdown. The timing to first fuel relocation was delayed by approximately 5 h for the FeCrAl ATF concept compared with that of the traditional Zircaloy-based cladding and channel box system.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

We also devised an algorithm to suggest the appropriate A100 Multi-Instance GPU profile from the output of DIPPM. We developed a methodology to convert DL models expressed in multiple frameworks to a generalized graph structure that is used in DIPPM. It means DIPPM can parse input DL models from various frameworks. Our DIPPM can be used not only helps to find suitable hardware configurations but also helps to perform rapid design-space exploration for the inference performance of a model. We constructed a graph multi-regression dataset consisting of 10,508 different DL models to train and evaluate the performance of DIPPM, and reached a resulting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as low as 1.9%.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}
{"title": "Optical Basicity and Nepheline Crystallization in High Alumina Glasses", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to find compositions that increase waste loading of high-alumina wastes beyond what is currently acceptable while avoiding crystallization of nepheline (NaAlSiO4) on slow cooling. Nepheline crystallization has been shown to have a large impact on the chemical durability of high-level waste glasses. It was hypothesized that there would be some composition regions where high-alumina would not result in nepheline crystal production, compositions not currently allowed by the nepheline discriminator. Optical basicity (OB) and the nepheline discriminator (ND) are two ways of describing a given complex glass composition. This report presents the theoretical and experimental basis for these models. They are being studied together in a quadrant system as metrics to explore nepheline crystallization and chemical durability as a function of waste glass composition. These metrics were calculated for glasses with existing data and also for theoretical glasses to explore nepheline formation in Quadrant IV (passes OB metric but fails ND metric), where glasses are presumed to have good chemical durability. Several of these compositions were chosen, and glasses were made to fill poorly represented regions in Quadrant IV. To evaluate nepheline formation and chemical durability of these glasses, quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the Product Consistency Test were conducted. A large amount of quantitative XRD data is collected here, both from new glasses and from glasses of previous studies that had not previously performed quantitative XRD on the phase assemblage. Appendix A critically discusses a large dataset to be considered for future quantitative studies on nepheline formation in glass. Appendix B provides a theoretical justification for choice of the oxide coefficients used to compute the OB criterion for nepheline formation.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

We present three benchmark collections of quantum mechanical data, covering approximately 3,700 distinct types of interacting molecule pairs. The first collection, which we refer to as DES370K, contains interaction energies for more than 370,000 dimer geometries. These were computed using the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)], which is widely regarded as the gold-standard method in electronic structure theory. Our second benchmark collection, a core representative subset of DES370K called DES15K, is intended for more computationally demanding applications of the data. Finally, DES5M, our third collection, comprises interaction energies for nearly 5,000,000 dimer geometries; these were calculated using SNS-MP2, a machine learning approach that provides results with accuracy comparable to that of our coupled-cluster training data.

Significant grain penetration in monolithic fuel plates produced by Hot Isostatic Press (HIP) fabrication processing is equally desirable but has yet to be attained. The goal of this study was to modify the 6061-Al in such a way as to promote a much greater extent of crossinterface grain penetration in monolithic fuel plates fabricated by the HIP process. This study documents the outcomes of several strategies attempted to attain this goal. The grain response was characterized using light optical microscopy (LOM) electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) as a function of these prospective process modifications done to the aluminum prior to the HIP cycle. The strategies included (1) adding macroscopic gaps in the sandwiches to enhance Al flow, (2) adding engineering asperities to enhance Al flow, (3) adding stored energy (cold work), and (4) alternative cleaning and coating. Additionally, two aqueous cleaning methods were compared as baseline control conditions. The results of the preliminary scoping studies in all the categories are presented. In general, none of these approaches were able to obtain >10% grain penetration.

{"title": "Complexity of many-body interactions in transition metals via machine-learned force fields from the TM23 data set", "abstract": "This work examines challenges associated with the accuracy of machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) for bulk solid and liquid phases of d-block elements. In exhaustive detail, we contrast the performance of force, energy, and stress predictions across the transition metals for two leading MLFF models: a kernel-based atomic cluster expansion method implemented using sparse Gaussian processes (FLARE), and an equivariant message-passing neural network (NequIP). Early transition metals present higher relative errors and are more difficult to learn relative to late platinum- and coinage-group elements, and this trend persists across model architectures. Trends in complexity of interatomic interactions for different metals are revealed via comparison of the performance of representations with different many-body order and angular resolution. Using arguments based on perturbation theory on the occupied and unoccupied d states near the Fermi level, we determine that the large, sharp d density of states both above and below the Fermi level in early transition metals leads to a more complex, harder-to-learn potential energy surface for these metals. Increasing the fictitious electronic temperature (smearing) modifies the angular sensitivity of forces and makes the early transition metal forces easier to learn. This work illustrates challenges in capturing intricate properties of metallic bonding with current leading MLFFs and provides a reference data set for transition metals, aimed at benchmarking the accuracy and improving the development of emerging machine-learned approximations.", "label": 1}

However, these often very short and incomplete remarks were not sufficient to reconstruct a complete analysis. But in fact it is relatively easy to export the complete executed protocol for reanalysis and inspection of results, when using a workflow environment in the first place to generate workflows.

{"title": "Parametric and experimentally informed BWR Severe Accident Analysis Utilizing FeCrAl - M3FT-17OR020205041", "abstract": "Iron-chromium-aluminum (FeCrAl) alloys are being considered as advanced fuel cladding concepts with enhanced accident tolerance. At high temperatures, FeCrAl alloys have slower oxidation kinetics and higher strength compared with zirconium-based alloys. FeCrAl could be used for fuel cladding and spacer or mixing vane grids in light water reactors and/or as channel box material in boiling water reactors (BWRs). There is a need to assess the potential gains afforded by the FeCrAl accident-tolerant-fuel (ATF) concept over the existing zirconium-based materials employed today. To accurately assess the response of FeCrAl alloys under severe accident conditions, a number of FeCrAl properties and characteristics are required. These include thermophysical properties as well as burst characteristics, oxidation kinetics, possible eutectic interactions, and failure temperatures. These properties can vary among different FeCrAl alloys. Oak Ridge National Laboratory has pursued refined values for the oxidation kinetics of the B136Y FeCrAl alloy (Fe-13Cr-6Al wt %). This investigation included oxidation tests with varying heating rates and end-point temperatures in a steam environment. The rate constant for the low-temperature oxidation kinetics was found to be higher than that for the commercial APMT FeCrAl alloy (Fe-21Cr-5Al-3Mo wt %). Compared with APMT, a 5 times higher rate constant best predicted the entire dataset (root mean square deviation). Based on tests following heating rates comparable with those the cladding would experience during a station blackout, the transition to higher oxidation kinetics occurs at approximately 1,500°C. A parametric study varying the low-temperature FeCrAl oxidation kinetics was conducted for a BWR plant using FeCrAl fuel cladding and channel boxes using the MELCOR code. A range of station blackout severe accident scenarios were simulated for a BWR/4 reactor with Mark I containment. Increasing the FeCrAl low-temperature oxidation rate constant (3 times and 10 times that of the rate constant for APMT) had a negligible impact on the early stages of the accident and minor impacts on the accident progression after the first relocation of the fuel. At temperatures below 1,500°C, increasing the rate constant for APMT by a factor of 10 still resulted in only minor FeCrAl oxidation. In general, the gains afforded by the FeCrAl enhanced ATF concept with respect to accident sequence timing and combustible gas generation are consistent with previous efforts. Compared with the traditional Zircaloy-based cladding and channel box system, the FeCrAl concept could provide a few extra hours of time for operators to take mitigating actions and/or for evacuations to take place. A coolable core geometry is retained longer, enhancing the ability to stabilize an accident. For example, a station blackout was simulated in which cooling water injection was lost 36 hours after shutdown. The timing to first fuel relocation was delayed by approximately 5 h for the FeCrAl ATF concept compared with that of the traditional Zircaloy-based cladding and channel box system.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

{"title": "Fast 2D NMR and Hyperpolarization", "abstract": "This chapter presents an overview of both the methodology and applications of fast two-dimensional (2D) NMR using nuclear spin hyperpolarization. Fast 2D NMR methods extend the information available from NMR experiments through spin correlations while allowing the utilization of large signals from hyperpolarized spins for the study of fast processes. Hyperpolarization methods typically provide orders of magnitude in NMR signal enhancement. In many cases, however, the mechanism of generating hyperpolarization imposes a technical limit on the number of repetitions of an experiment. Conventional multi-dimensional NMR methods, which rely on re-polarization of spins between each scan, are therefore not directly applicable. Two-dimensional or pseudo 2D NMR experiments can nevertheless be implemented using specific techniques such as ultrafast pulsed-field gradient encoding, sequential scanning with scan-to-scan preservation of spin polarization, or off-resonance decoupling. Intermolecular or intramolecular spin polarization transfer and the observation of correlations between reactants and products can be integrated into these experiments. These and other techniques can be used for the determination of mechanisms in fast chemical reactions or the elucidation of molecular interactions.

Both of these drivers have identified understanding and mitigating fuel cracking as a key performance criterion. Small-scale cantilever beam testing has been identified as a plausible method by which to collect fracture data for UO2 as a function of chemical and structural evolutions introduced either during fabrication or irradiation. While this method has been found to be capable of providing data that are in reasonable agreement with literature for unirradiated UO2, the inherently small sample volumes that can be sampled limit its ability to capture the statistical nature of mechanisms that govern the fracture of brittle ceramics. A biaxial flexure strength test was developed to be used for unirradiated UO2. This method is standard in the community, but no systems presently in use at national laboratories, universities, or private companies are available to be used for nuclear fuel materials. This report describes the operation and benchmarking of this system, which has been validated for a number of common oxides. Future work will extend this system to characterization of both doped UO2 and other relevant microstructural modifications that can also be measured using small-scale cantilever beam testing.

Many such models have been trained using protein-ligand complexes with known crystal structures and activities from the PDBBind data set. However, because PDBbind only includes 20K complexes, models typically fail to generalize to new targets, and model performance is on par with models trained with only ligand information. Conversely, the ChEMBL database contains a wealth of chemical activity information but includes no information about binding poses. We introduce BigBind, a data set that maps ChEMBL activity data to proteins from the CrossDocked data set. BigBind comprises 583 K ligand activities and includes 3D structures of the protein binding pockets. Additionally, we augmented the data by adding an equal number of putative inactives for each target. Using this data, we developed Banana (basic neural network for binding affinity), a neural network-based model to classify active from inactive compounds, defined by a 10 μM cutoff. Our model achieved an AUC of 0.72 on BigBind's test set, while a ligand-only model achieved an AUC of 0.59.

The TCR fuel form consists of an additively-manufactured silicon carbide (SiC) matrix and uranium nitride tristructural isotropic (UN TRISO) fuel particles, which is manufactured through a newly developed processing route combining binderjet 3D printing, TRISO fuel particle loading, and chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Because the fuel matrix is a primary component of the TCR core and its response to mechanical and thermal loads during operation is one of the most influential factors on the integrity of TCR core, testing and evaluation have focused on producing mechanical and thermophysical properties data for the binderjet/CVI SiC. Baseline mechanical and thermophysical properties were measured from the disk specimens printed for different and sizes orientations, which included equibiaxial flexural failure strength, elastic constants, thermal diffusivity and conductivity, density, and the coefficient of thermal expansion. Flexural failure strength datasets showed similar Weibull distributions regardless of sample variants including different orientations. The mean failure strengths of the 3D-printed SiC variants were in the range of 280–310 MPa, which are slightly lower than that of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) SiC. Thermophysical test results showed that specific heat and thermal expansion are not sensitive to the build direction of SiC samples, while thermal conductivity is highly dependent on the build direction and can be correlated to the anisotropic character of the 3D-printed SiC. Neutron irradiation tests were carried out on the 3D-printed 6-mm diameter SiC disk specimens. Irradiation was carried to 2.3 dpa over a temperature range of 360–880°C. No significant degradation in strength was observed in SiC after irradiations in various conditions and with different orientations. Anisotropy that had been observed in the thermal conductivity of 3D-printed SiC prior to irradiation vanished after irradiation as the irradiation defect thermal resistivity accumulated in the material. Electron microscopy of the microstructure after neutron irradiation showed distinct defect morphologies in the heterogenous material, but no evidence for irradiation-induced cracking or degradation in the microstructure was observed.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

A crucial aspect of these processes is to expand the number of candidate polymer structures, as the currently known real polymer structures are very limited. In contrast, small molecule databases are vast, offering extensive opportunities for the design of new molecules, such as drug discovery. In this study, we collected extensive small molecule compounds from GDB-17, GDB-13, and PubChem and selected polymerization reaction pathways for eight types of polymers, including polyimide, polyolefin, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, epoxy, polybenzimidazole (PBI), and vitrimer. These small molecule datasets and polymerization reactions enabled us to generate hundreds of quadrillions of hypothetical polymer structures. For each of the eight polymers, along with one promising copolymer, poly(imide-imine), we randomly generated over one million hypothetical structures, except for PBI, for which we created 10 000 structures. Chemical space visualization using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and synthetic accessibility scores were employed to assess the feasibility of synthesizing these new polymers. Customized feedforward neural network models predicted thermal, mechanical, and gas permeation properties for both real and hypothetical polymers. The results show that many hypothetical polymers, especially polyimides, exhibit significant potential, often surpassing real polymers in performance, particularly for high-temperature applications and gas separation. Our findings highlight the immense potential of large-scale hypothetical polymer libraries for materials discovery and design. These libraries not only aid in identifying promising polymer materials through high-throughput screening but also provide valuable datasets for training advanced machine learning models, such as large language models.

These fires kill about 4,000 people, injure 20,000 people, and result in property losses amounting to about US$4.5 billion. Flame retardants are additives that can make flammable materials more difficult to ignite and significantly reduce the spread of fire. Use of flame retardants plays a major role in fire safety, saving lives, and preventing injuries and property damage. For example, in 1974, the number of recorded television set fires in the United Kingdom was more than 2,300, whereas this number had decreased to 470 in 1989, despite the number of television sets in use increasing many times. This is because effective flame retardants were developed for television sets.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
{"title": "Image Segmentation for Food Sustainability: A Machine Learning Approach", "abstract": "Singapore aims to achieve the 30–30 food goal to promote food sustainability. In line with this, biodigesters minimize food waste by using microbes to convert it into fertilizer and biogas. However, foreign objects thrown in, like bones, oily food, etc., which cannot be decomposed by microbes within, limit their effectiveness. Thus, separating these objects from digestible waste through image segmentation is paramount to the success of biodigesters. Existing image segmentation methods include traditional ones like GrabCut, which use colour and contrast to construct an energy function for minimization, while neural network-based methods like YOLO and R-CNN use backpropagation to optimize parameters. In this paper, we attempt to segment bones from food waste images. We prepared a dataset of 108 images of bones to train a CNN to recognize bones and tested it on labelling bounding boxes around bones in 20 food waste images (half of which actually contained bones). Out of the 10 images of food waste containing bones, we tested GrabCut's ability to segment the bones from the remaining bounding boxes. Unfortunately, images of food waste containing bones were highly limited on the Internet. We found the CNN performed poorly. Our small dataset possibly led to the CNN not learning to filter background noise. For GrabCut, we obtained best performance with maximum foreground-background contrast, but not otherwise. We propose modifying the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to account for more background variation and less foreground variation. Overall, our results show some promise but harnessing our tools' full potential requires further research.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

The study will provide critical insight into the fundamental behavior (processing-microstructure- property correlations) of W-Re alloys made using this new fabrication process comprising high-energy ball milling (HEBM) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). A broader goal is to re-establish the U.S. lead in the research field of refractory alloys, such as W-Re systems, with potential applications in very high-temperature nuclear reactors. An essential long-term goal for nuclear power is to develop the capability of operating nuclear reactors at temperatures in excess of 1,000K. This capability has applications in space exploration and some special terrestrial uses where high temperatures are needed in certain chemical or reforming processes. Refractory alloys have been identified as being capable of withstanding temperatures in excess of 1,000K and are considered critical for the development of ultra hightemperature reactors. Tungsten alloys are known to possess extraordinary properties, such as excellent high-temperature capability, including the ability to resist leakage of fissile materials when used as a fuel clad.

A reliable high-resolution structural characterization of these assemblies is frequently beyond the reach of current experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, footprinting, chemical cross-linking, FRET spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and proteomics. However, the information garnered from different methods can be combined and used to build models of the assembly structures that are consistent with all of the available datasets, and therefore more accurate, precise, and complete. Here, we describe a protocol for this integration, whereby the information is converted to a set of spatial restraints and a variety of optimization procedures can be used to generate models that satisfy the restraints as well as possible.

The most difficult task for global researchers today is to develop anticancer leads with minimal side effects. Heterocyclic chemistry is an important and unique class of medicinal chemistry as a large number of drugs being used in chemotherapy have a heterocyclic ring as their basic structure, in spite of various side effects. Because of the presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, heterocyclic compounds can be used as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. As a result, they can more effectively bind to pharmacological targets and receptors via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in pharmacological effects. They can also change the liposolubility and thus the aqueous solubility of drug molecules, resulting in remarkable pharmacotherapeutic properties. Medicinal chemists are concentrating on anticancer agents based on heterocyclic compounds. The goal of this chapter is to attempt to compile a dataset of advances in various nitrogen and oxygen-containing heterocyclic rings with anticancer activities from 2017 to 2020.

To this end, we develop an equilibrium message passing neural network (EMPNN) to better capture ground-state geometries from molecular graphs. To provide a testbed for 3D molecular geometry analysis, we develop a benchmark that includes a dataset with precise ground-state geometries of approximately 4 million molecules. Experimental results show that EMPNN can efficiently predict more accurate ground-state 3D geometries than RDKit and other deep learning methods.

{"title": "Ballistic Performance of Bi-layer Graphene: Artificial Neural Network Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations", "abstract": "In the present article, we explored the ballistic behaviour of bilayer graphene (BLG) by performing a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The computationally expensive nature of large scale MD simulations frequently hinders a thorough understanding of material characterization. To mitigate this lacuna we demonstrated the successful integration of MD simulation with the artificial neural network (ANN). In this regard, the considered input parameter [impact velocity (Vi)] is perturbed in the range of 1–7 km/s using the Monte Carlo sampling technique to construct the sample space with 128 instances. The BLG (size 200 Å × 200 Å) is impacted by a spherical diamond projectile (diameter 25 Å) in a series of MD simulations of high-velocity impact with varied impact velocities. As a response, the residual velocity of the projectile (Vr) and specific penetration energy ( $$E_{p}^{*}$$ ) of the BLG are determined for each instance. The deterministic responses revealed that with the increase in the impact velocity the Vr and $$E_{p}^{*}$$ values increases. Besides the numerical responses, the post-impact behaviour of BLG is also classified into four different stages viz. R, PP1, PP2 and CP, based on the extent of damage to the BLG and the post-impact trajectory of the projectile. The dataset generated with the MCS based MD simulation is further used to construct the ANN based regression and classification model. In this manner, the current article proposed a framework to accelerate the nanoscale material characterization by augmenting the ANN with MD simulations.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": true}

{"title": "Industrial Frying and Seasoning Operations", "abstract": "Frying and seasoning are the hallmark and final operations of most snacks. The combination of the type of frying oil, frying equipment, and its operational conditions greatly influences end-product features. Frying is of upmost relevance for processors because snacks must fulfill new demands of informed consumers who are concerned about their health and wellness. The frying operation is complex because it associates energy, mass, and momentum transport principles. Hitherto, oil absorption is a complex phenomenon that still requires investigation because it is affected by the type of food matrix especially in terms of moisture content, degree of starch gelatinization, and internal structure. Frying may induce significant changes in snacks like the degradation of nutrition beneficial compounds and the formation of toxic compounds (chapter 20). These changes are directly linked to the use of high temperatures as well as the presence of oxygen that enhances oxidation reactions. Vacuum-frying is a novel technology, which enables removing product moisture, in a low-oxygen environment, at a comparatively low temperature. The application of liquid or powdered-based seasonings has been a crucial industrial operation because it is closely related to the quality, flavor profile, and consumer acceptance of snacks. Seasoning formulations discussed in Chapter 8 are applied by industrial devices that distribute homogeneously a given amount of covering. There are basically three different major processes to apply seasonings. Devices designed to apply dry or powdered salt and compound seasonings, coaters furnished with a single or one phase spraying device, which delivers liquid slurries, and more complex coaters designed to deliver the total seasoning in two-phases (liquid–liquid or liquid–dry seasoning).

{"title": "Materials science optimization benchmark dataset for multi-objective, multi-fidelity optimization of hard-sphere packing simulations", "abstract": "In scientific disciplines, benchmarks play a vital role in driving progress forward. For a benchmark to be effective, it must closely resemble real-world tasks. If the level of difficulty or relevance is inadequate, it can impede progress in the field. Moreover, benchmarks should have low computational overhead to ensure accessibility and repeatability. The objective is to achieve a kind of “Turing test” by creating a surrogate model that is practically indistinguishable from the ground truth observation, at least within the dataset’s explored boundaries. This objective necessitates a large quantity of data. This data encompasses numerous features that are characteristic of chemistry and materials science optimization tasks that are relevant to industry. These features include high levels of noise, multiple fidelities, multiple objectives, linear constraints, non-linear correlations, and failure regions. We performed 494,498 random hard-sphere packing simulations representing 206 CPU days’ worth of computational overhead. Simulations required nine input parameters with linear constraints and two discrete fidelities each with continuous fidelity parameters. The results were logged in a free-tier shared MongoDB Atlas database, producing two core tabular datasets: a failure probability dataset and a regression dataset. The failure probability dataset maps unique input parameter sets to the estimated probabilities that the simulation will fail. The regression dataset maps input parameter sets (including repeats) to particle packing fractions and computational runtimes for each of the two steps. These two datasets were used to create a surrogate model as close as possible to running the actual simulations by incorporating simulation failure and heteroskedastic noise. In the regression dataset, percentile ranks were calculated for each group of identical parameter sets to account for heteroskedastic noise, thereby ensuring reliable and accurate data.

{"title": "Dislocation Motion in Slip Bands of Neutron-Irradiated Copper Crystals", "abstract": "Velocities of the groups of screw dislocations (vs) and edge ones (ve) in neutron-irradiated copper crystals were measured at room temperature by observing dynamically the growth of primary slip bands in length. The length of the slip bands increased linearly with time over a long distance. The mean ↑value of vs was smaller than that of ve. From these results, the followings are concluded: (i) The motion of dislocations is not controlled only by the elastic interaction between moving dislocations and irradiation-produced defect clusters but by the jogs resulting from the cutting of small loops by moving dislocations. (ii) The slip bands grow in length and width by the successive formation of dislocation sources by double cross slip like a relay-race.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
{"title": "Reference Vertical Excitation Energies for Transition Metal Compounds", "abstract": "To enrich and enhance the diversity of the QUEST database of highly-accurate excitation energies, we report vertical transition energies in transition metal compounds. Eleven diatomic molecules with singlet or doublet ground state containing a fourth-row transition metal (CuCl, CuF, CuH, ScF, ScH, ScO, ScS, TiN, ZnH, ZnO, and ZnS) are considered and the corresponding excitation energies are computed using high-level coupled-cluster (CC) methods, namely CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ, as well as multiconfigurational methods such as CASPT2 and NEVPT2. In some cases, to provide more comprehensive benchmark data, we also provide full configuration interaction estimates computed with the \"Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively\" (CIPSI) method. Based on these calculations, theoretical best estimates of the transition energies are established in both the aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. This allows us to accurately assess the performance of CC and multiconfigurational methods for this specific set of challenging transitions. Furthermore, comparisons with experimental data and previous theoretical results are also reported.", "label": 1}
{"title": "Materials Transformers Language Models for Generative Materials Design: a benchmark study", "abstract": "Pre-trained transformer language models on large unlabeled corpus have produced state-of-the-art results in natural language processing, organic molecule design, and protein sequence generation. However, no such models have been applied to learn the composition patterns of inorganic materials. Here we train a series of seven modern transformer language models (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, BLMM, BART, and RoBERTa) using the expanded formulas from material deposited in the ICSD, OQMD, and Materials Projects databases. Six different datasets with/out non-charge-neutral or balanced electronegativity samples are used to benchmark the performances and uncover the generation biases of modern transformer models for the generative design of materials compositions. Our extensive experiments showed that the causal language models based materials transformers can generate chemically valid materials compositions with as high as 97.54% to be charge neutral and 91.40% to be electronegativity balanced, which has more than 6 times higher enrichment compared to a baseline pseudo-random sampling algorithm. These models also demonstrate high novelty and their potential in new materials discovery has been proved by their capability to recover the leave-out materials. We also find that the properties of the generated samples can be tailored by training the models with selected training sets such as high-bandgap materials. Our experiments also showed that different models each have their own preference in terms of the properties of the generated samples and their running time complexity varies a lot. We have applied our materials transformer models to discover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations.", "label": 1}
{"title": "Maximising the hydrogen evolution activity in organic photocatalysts by co-polymerisation", "abstract": "The hydrogen evolution activity of a polymeric photocatalyst was maximised by co-polymerisation, using both experimental and computational screening, for a family of 1,4-phenylene/2,5-thiophene co-polymers. The photocatalytic activity is the product of multiple material properties that are affected in different ways by the polymer composition and microstructure. For the first time, the photocatalytic activity was shown to be a function of the arrangement of the building blocks in the polymer chain as well as the overall composition. The maximum in hydrogen evolution for the co-polymer series appears to result from a trade-off between the fraction of light absorbed and the thermodynamic driving force for proton reduction and sacrificial electron donor oxidation, with the co-polymer of p-terphenyl and 2,5-thiophene showing the highest activity.", "label": 1}

{"title": "CHAPTER 9. Organic Compounds as Electrodes for Rechargeable Mg Batteries", "abstract": "Redox active organic materials can be considered as a suitable host matrix for multivalent cations due to their open structure caused by relatively weak intermolecular forces. Their application in realistic two electrode rechargeable magnesium batteries has been realized after the discovery of non-nucleophilic electrolytes. Different groups have tested and proposed several families of redox active organic materials. Among them, materials based on conjugated carbonyls can be seen as the most promising direction, since practical batteries with an average discharge voltage of 2 V could be obtained and with proper design of redox active organic polymers, a battery with a theoretical energy density close to 700 W h kg−1 could be realized. The mechanism of the redox process of conjugated carbonyl compounds occurs through the reversible reduction of carbonyl bonds. It is proposed that the low volumetric energy density of a cathode based on redox active organic materials is compensated by the high volumetric energy density of metallic magnesium. The remaining problems of redox active organic materials are mainly due to their solubility in electrolytes based on organic solvents, which affects the cycling stability. In addition, reports on water-based electrolytes show much better electrochemical stability. Stability issues, together with the optimization of several battery engineering parameters, such as the content of electron conductive additives, the amount of required electrolyte and areal loadings of both electrodes will in future determine the practical viability of Mg–organic batteries.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": false}
