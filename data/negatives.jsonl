We also found that the polarization-splitting planes in cubic crystals can be accessed in two crystal orientations, a property that can be used to decrease the clutter in polarized spectra. In parallel, we developed a ray-tracing code and are working to add the crystal reflectivity to instrument modeling codes, to help us interpret the spectra and to design spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric instruments.

Consideration of carbon nanotube fiber reinforced polymer composites in structural applications requires a broad characterization of their performance under a variety of loading conditions. To that end, short beam strength, axial flexure, transverse flexure, compression, and tension tests are conducted on carbon nanotube fiber reinforced epoxy composites. For each test, composites made from three different formats of carbon nanotube fiber reinforcement with a high weight (or volume) percentage of reinforcement up to 70 wt.% (68 vol.%) are compared.

{"title": "Effect of Carbide Segregation on Mode I Fatigue Resistance Properties of the Bearing Tool Steel Roll Blade Die", "abstract": "Roll blade die (RBD) is a carburized tool steel containing 10 weight percent (wt%) tungsten that was initially designed for forging gas turbine engine blades. It therefore has very high hardness at room and elevated temperatures, resistance to wear, and low distortion. Due to high tungsten content, RBD can exhibit segregation of tungsten carbide in the form of randomly distributed coarse carbide stringers (greater than 600 µm in length) instead of the usual more uniform distribution of finer (less than or equal to 4.3 µm in equivalent circle diameter) carbides within the martensitic structure. Individual tungsten carbides within these coarse stringers can have sizes up to 14.7 µm in equivalent circle diameter (ECD). As a result of such segregation, these carbide stringers have been shown to be visible as an indication on the working surface of a bearing track when subjected to magnetic particle inspection (MPI) at high current flow. This paper presents the use of Mode I fatigue testing to test such indications and compare the results with identical indication free samples. Mode I was chosen as it had the advantage of maintaining the MPI indications in their original condition and it was also considered pessimistic with regard to any potential fatigue deficit observed compared to the rolling contact fatigue. The Mode I fatigue test results demonstrated no reduction in fatigue resistance in the samples with MPI indications compared to the identical indication free samples. Fractography revealed that non-metallic inclusions were located at the fatigue crack initiation sites. These findings suggest that the presence of MPI indications, which are associated with the coarse tungsten carbide stringers, had minimal effect on the fatigue resistance properties of the RBD tool steel under Mode I conditions.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}
{"title": "Advances in Drug-delivery Systems Based on Intrinsically Conducting Polymers", "abstract": "Intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) are organic polymers with unique capabilities including the ability to conduct electricity. The release of drugs from ICP-based drug delivery systems can be controlled using electrical signaling to alter the redox state of the ICP, leading to subsequent changes in polymer charge and volume. The increasing use of ICPs in drug delivery systems can be attributed to their biocompatible nature and the ability to regulate drug release electrically. Drug can be easily incorporated into these polymers by physical and chemical means. As the release of the drugs from ICPs is in accordance with electrical stimulus the therapeutic effect can be maximized with a reduction in the side effects. In this chapter a general overview of ICPs, their electrochemical properties and the techniques used to characterize these materials with specifics pertaining to drug delivery is provided.

GABA is also an amino acid that your brain uses as a neurotransmitter and it is almost always inhibitory. These two neurotransmitters are widespread in your brain and tend to compete for turning your neurons on or off. Glutamate makes and breaks connections between neurons; this action allows your brain to learn. For example, if you consume a chemical that blocks the actions of glutamate you become amnestic, unable to remember anything new. The street drugs PCP and ketamine block glutamate receptors and depress the activity of your brain. Your brain makes its own PCP-like neurotransmitter called angeldustin. Chemicals that enhance the action of GABA, such as alcohol, barbiturates, or any of the popular drugs related to Valium and Librium, can make us sleepy, send us into a coma, or kill us by turning off too many neurons in the brain.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

The accumulation of nondegradable dyes in environment poses serious health threats. Different conventional methods have been reported so far as being used to degrade the dyes from environment. Photodegradation is one of the most promising, cost-effective and facile methods to remove dyes. Recently, biomaterials have been used as a new frontier to degrade dyes by heterogeneous photodegradation, and it has appeared as the most emerging technology due to its cost effectiveness.

{"title": "Prediction and Accommodation: The Acceptance of Mendeleev’s Periodic System", "abstract": "Although periodic systems were produced independently by six codiscoverers in the space of a decade, Dmitri Mendeleev’s system is the one that has had the greatest impact by far. Not only was Mendeleev’s system more complete than the others, but he also worked much harder and longer for its acceptance. He also went much further than the other codiscoverers in publicly demonstrating the validity of his system by using it to predict the existence of a number of hitherto unknown elements. According to the popular story, it was Mendeleev’s many successful predictions that were directly responsible for the widespread acceptance of the periodic system, while his competitors either failed to make predictions or did so in a rather feeble manner. Several of his predictions were indeed widely celebrated, especially those of the elements germanium, gallium, and scandium, and many historians have argued that it was such spectacular feats that assured the acceptance of Mendeleev’s periodic system by the scientific community. The notion that scientific theories are accepted primarily if they make successful predictions seems to be rather well ingrained into scientific culture, and the history of the periodic table has been one of the episodes through which this notion has been propagated. However, philosophers and some scientists have long debated the extent to which predictions influence the acceptance of scientific theories, and it is by no means a foregone conclusion that successful predictions are more telling than other factors. In looking closely at the bulk of Mendeleev’s predictions in this chapter, it becomes clear that, at best, only half of them proved to be correct. This raises a number of questions. First of all, why is it that history has been so kind to Mendeleev as a maker of predictions? As historian of chemistry William Brock has pointed out, “Not all of Mendeleev’s predictions had such a happy outcome; like astrologers’ failures, they are commonly forgotten.”", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

{"title": "Metal Hydride Compression", "abstract": "Conventional hydrogen compressors often contribute over half of the cost of hydrogen stations, have poor reliability, and have insufficient flow rates for a mature fuel cell vehicle market. Fatigue associated with their moving parts including cracking of diaphragms and failure of seals leads to failure in conventional compressors, which is exacerbated by the repeated starts and stops expected at fueling stations. Furthermore, the conventional lubrication of these compressors with oil is generally unacceptable at fueling stations due to potential fuel contamination. MH technology offers a very good alternative to both conventional (mechanical) and newly developed (electrochemical, ionic liquid pistons) methods of hydrogen compression. Advantages of MH compression include simplicity in design and operation, absence of moving parts, compactness, safety and reliability, and the possibility to utilize waste industrial heat to power the compressor. Beyond conventional H2 supply via pipelines or tanker trucks, another attractive scenario is the on-site generation and delivery of pure H2 at pressure (> 875 bar) for refueling vehicles at electrolysis, wind, or solar H2 production facilities in distributed locations that are too remote or widely distributed for cost effective bulk transport. MH hydrogen compression utilizes a reversible heat-driven interaction of a hydride-forming metal alloy with hydrogen gas to form the MH phase and is a promising process for hydrogen energy applications. To deliver hydrogen continuously, each stage of the compressor must consist of multiple MH beds with synchronized hydrogenation & dehydrogenation cycles. Multistage pressurization allows achievement of greater compression ratios using reduced temperature swings compared to single stage compressors. The objectives of this project are to investigate and demonstrate on a laboratory scale a twostage MH hydrogen gas compressor with a feed pressure of >100 bar and a delivery pressure > 875 bar of high purity H2 gas using the scheme shown in Figure 1. Progress to date includes the selection of metal hydrides for each compressor stage based on experimental characterization of their thermodynamics, kinetics, and hydrogen capacities for optimal performance with respect to energy requirements and efficiency. Additionally, final bed designs have been completed based on trade studies and all components have been ordered. The prototype two-stage compressor will be fabricated, assembled, and experimentally evaluated in FY19.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

In this chapter, the recycling of both polymer (polylactic acid [PLA]) and reinforcement fibers (PLA/cellulose composite) have been studied under compost, landfill, incineration, mechanical (primary and secondary), and chemical recycling (tertiary). Other than the environmental advantages of the recycling process, such as reducing greenhouse gasses and petroleum-based fuel, there are several disadvantages such as decreased cellulosic fiber length, mechanical and thermal properties, and molecular weight of the polymer and composite. Due to these negative properties, it is crucial to select the best recycling method which can recover the PLA and PLA/cellulose with functional properties.

{"title": "Selecting Separation Modes and Selectivities for Multi-Dimensional LC", "abstract": "One of the most important steps in the development of any 2D-LC method involves choosing which modes of separation to use (e.g., reversed-phase (RP), ion-exchange, etc.). The rationale leading to this step involves not only the characteristics of the analytes in the sample at hand, but also the likelihood that the two separations chosen at this stage will work well together in a 2D separation system. In this chapter we first discuss how the concept of \"sample dimensionality\" can be used as a framework for choosing which two separation modes to use. We then go on to discuss how different combinations of modes do or do not work well together in 2D systems, and briefly discuss strengths and weaknesses of individual separation modes as they relate to multi-dimensional separations. Finally, in the specific case of RP separations we summarize strategies that have been used to select specific stationary phases for use in 2D-LC separations involving RP in at least one dimension.

{"title": "Treatment of Liver and Gastric Cancer Using Nanoemulsion", "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Current chemotherapy challenges the lack of selectivity, cytotoxicity, the development of multi-drug resistance, and the proliferation of stem-like cells. One of the leading causes of new cancer cases and cancer-related fatalities is a group of deadly malignant tumors known as liver and gastric cancer. Advanced gastric cancer is classified as having liver metastases and is one of the deadliest conditions with a dismal prognosis. As gastric cancer with liver metastases is incurable, systematic chemotherapy is the primary line of treatment, although surgery is typically used to relieve severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The main method for delivering various medications, nucleic acids, and imaging agents is nanoemulsion (NE). Nevertheless, NE is created through many functions, including surface changes and the encapsulation of active cancer-fighting substances. Because of their excellent characteristics to solubilize hydrophobic chemotherapeutics, thermodynamic stability, biocompatibility, and target ability, NEs are an appealing platform for cancer treatment.

{"title": "Self-Healing Coatings", "abstract": "Metal corrosion is a natural and inevitable process that imposes a lot of cost on many industries and can also have irreparable consequences. Several methods, such as cathodic protection, galvanizing, painting, and coatings, are available to prevent metal corrosion. Selection of the best corrosion prevention method depends on many factors including cost, effectiveness, type of metal, and corrosive media but it can be said that coatings are probably the most convenient method to prevent corrosion of metals due to the low cost, availability of raw materials, flexibility, and simplicity. Despite having many advantages, coatings are subject to problems such as cracking and degradation. Therefore, they must be repaired or replaced. Self-healing coating has been introduced and developed during the past decades as a very effective method to overcome the problems of traditional coatings. Self-healing means healing (recover/repair) internal damages automatically and autonomously. It is an amazing property that can fill cracks and small pinholes which leads to increased service lives of coatings.

New 18techniques in the development of a science novel used to make water diversity are among the best and most exciting. In addition, the material taken from nanotechnology limits the focus of lethal computing to sub levels, which helps in obtaining high water quality requirements and durability specifications. There are different types of nanomatadium, which carried a large latent to deal with contaminated water very effectively due to their presence only as a high surface area, capable of operating at low latency, etc. With one step of a combination of gold (Au), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt), and palladium (Pd) NPs in water, Sodium Rhodizonate was once used as an effective mitigation agent as a stabilizing agent.

{"title": "Progress Report on FY15 Crystalline Experiments M4FT-15LL0807052", "abstract": "Colloid-facilitated plutonium transport is expected to be the dominant mechanism in its migration through the environment. The forms of Pu colloids (intrinsic versus pseudo-colloid) and their stabilities control temporal and spatial scales of Pu transport in the environment. In the present study, we examine the stability of Pu intrinsic colloids freshly prepared in alkaline solution relative to Pu-montmorillonite pseudo-colloids using a dialysis device and modeling approaches. Intrinsic colloids prepared under alkaline conditions were found to be unstable over a timescale of months. The kinetics of multiple processes, including hydrolysis/precipitation of Pu(IV), dissolution of intrinsic colloids in the absence and presence of the clay colloids, transport of dissolved Pu species across the dialysis membrane, and formation of pseudo-colloids were examined. The dissolution of intrinsic colloids was the rate-limiting process in most cases. The apparent intrinsic colloid dissolution rate constants range from 6×10-7 to 1×10- 6 mol·m-2·day-1 and 4×10-6 to 8×10-6 mol·m-2·day-1 at 25 and 80°C, respectively, while the apparent diffusion rate constants for Pu ions crossing the dialysis membrane are >200 times higher. Elevated temperatures enhance dissolution of Pu colloids and the activation energy for the process is estimated to be 28 kJ mol-1. The sorption of Pu to montmorillonite appears to be endothermic as the affinity of Pu for the clay increases with increasing temperature. Our results provide an in-depth understanding of how intrinsic and pseudo-colloids interact with each other kinetically. Although the fact that intrinsic colloids tend to dissolve in the presence of montmorillonite and transform into pseudo-colloids may limit the migration of intrinsic colloids, the thermodynamically more stable pseudo-colloids may play an important role in Pu transport in the environment over significant temporal and spatial scales.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}
{"title": "Nanocarriers: Promising Vehicles for Controlled Bioactive Drug Delivery in Current Medical System", "abstract": "Nanomaterials have been widely employed in the medical profession in recent decades, thanks to the rapid development of nanotechnology. Their distinctive physical and chemical qualities, such as minimal size, functionalized surface characteristics, stable interactions with ligands, high carrier capacity, and ease of binding with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances have made them ideal platforms for the target-specific and controlled delivery of micro-and macromolecules in disease therapy and have revealed an excellent potential pertaining to clinical entities with the goal of fine-tuning bioavailability, bioefficacy, and pharmacokinetics. The absorption, post-administration stability as well as bioavailability of bioactive drugs and other medicinal substances are the key issues. Some critical medications have low gastrointestinal absorption and permeability in their active form, are inactivated by pH and temperature fluctuations and cause catastrophic off-target and undesirable side effects. Certain investigations have also indicated that active efflux mechanisms affect the absorption of some presently integrated compounds with structural alterations across the intestinal wall. Furthermore, intestinal bacteria and/or enzymes break down fragile structures of active substances into a variety of metabolites, each of which has different bioactivity than the original chemical compound. Nanocarrier-mediated distribution improved their solubilization potential, changed absorption paths, and reduced metabolic breakdown by gut bacteria and enzymes. Combining nanobiotechnology with current therapeutic techniques has shown to be effective in bringing innovative and previously rejected bioactive substances to the market for treating a myriad of diseases and disorders. As a result, we predict that nanotechnology will play a larger role in illness detection and treatment in the future, perhaps helping to overcome bottlenecks in current medical approaches.

{"title": "Microscopy and Microanalysis of Insulating Materials", "abstract": "Most materials in the human environment are insulators. The absence of conduction electrons in monocrystalline insulators may explain the fact that these materials have, at least at the initial stage of the irradiation, a secondary electron yield of about one order of magnitude greater than that of metals. The absence of electron-electron interactions increases the attenuation length of the emitted secondary electrons. The electrostatic approach explains at least qualitatively the main aspects of charging and the spurious effects that may occur during the investigation of insulating materials by incident electron beam techniques. The problem of irradiation by light and mobile particles such as electrons is more difficult. The electron-hole pairs generated by photoabsorption induce a surface photoconductivity which allows excess charge to flow to earth. If the electrostatic approach is considered in more detail for electron irradiation, it is necessary to obtain more information on the trapping mechanism for electrons.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

However, despite these promising features, organic π-conjugated polymer-based technologies suffer from limited lifetime stabilities, and the materials intrinsic solubility in common organic solvents makes advanced fabrication techniques, such as multilayer deposition and nanoscale lithography, challenging.

A selection of conventional alloys, SiC-based ceramics and model alloys were used to explore a wide range of materials options and provide guidance for future materials development work. Typically, the SiC-based ceramic materials, alumina-forming alloys and Fe-Cr alloys with {ge}25% Cr showed the best potential for oxidation resistance at {ge}1200 C. At 1350 C, FeCrAl alloys and SiC remained oxidation resistant in steam. Conventional austenitic steels do not have sufficient oxidation resistance with only {approx}18Cr-10Ni.

In addition, new concepts that pertain to fuel-cell science and technology—NANOCOFC (www.nanocofc.com)—are explored and developed. To commercialise SOFCs, researchers have sought to reduce their operating temperatures by developing new electrolyte materials with high ionic conductivities. However, the operation of SOFCs remains costly using conventional methods, and a reduction in operating temperature would significantly reduce both component (including inter-connects, sealing materials, and manifold materials) and manufacturing costs. The content of this chapter is divided into three below parts: Development of materials: Nanocomposite electrolytes synthesis through different chemical routes is described. The particle size is optimised at the nano-ordered scale. The ionic conduction phenomena and ionic transport number will be measured and discussed, as they relate to the dependence on the structure, composition, and morphology of the nanoparticles in the solid and molten phases. Characterisation and analysis : The crystalline structure, microstructure, and morphology of the synthesised nanocomposite materials are characterised by XRD, SEM with EDX, and TEM. The main route of ionic conduction is the interface between the solid and liquid phases, which are investigated through high-temperature Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, the thermal properties and phase-transition phenomena obtained from the thermal analyses (TG-DTA, DSC) are investigated to determine the effect of the solid phase and optimise the operating conditions of the ASOFC. Advanced electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to determine the interfaces and electrochemical mechanism. Demonstration of the nanocomposite materials for an ASOFC: The composition of the developed materials is optimised based on extensive material characterisations and fuel-cell measurements. The performance of the fuel cells is used to direct further material developments.

{"title": "Heat Recovery and Power Generation Using Thermoelectric Generator", "abstract": "In this chapter, experimental analysis of the direct conversion of thermal energy into electric energy was carried out, in order to encourage the conscious use of energy and to reduce waste. The conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy occurs in a thermoelectric generator through the Seebeck effect. This effect is associated with the appearance of an electric potential difference between two different materials, placed in contact at different temperatures. This relation between temperature and electrical properties of the material is known as thermoelectricity. This experimental study has as objective the obtaining of operating characteristic curves of the thermoelectric generator TEG1-12611-6.0, for different temperature gradients and under constant pressure between the heater plate and the heat sink. Resistors were used to heat the thermoelectric generator, which simulates the residual heat, and insulation material to minimize the dissipation of heat to the environment. For cooling, a heat exchanger was used in order to maximize the temperature difference between the sides of the thermoelectric generator. In this way, it was possible to perform an experimental analysis of the obtained electric power for different temperature ranges between the faces of the generator and, with this, verify the applicability in real systems.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

{"title": "Element 72—Hafnium", "abstract": "The story concerning the discovery and isolation of element 72 bears all the characteristics of controversy and nationalistic overtones that seems to characterize many of our seven elements. On one hand, it seems odd that there should be so much controversy associated with these elements given that Moseley’s method had apparently provided an unequivocal means through which elements could be identified as well as a way of knowing just how many elements remained to be discovered. On the other hand, perhaps it was precisely because the problem of the missing elements became so clearly focused on a few elements, with known atomic numbers, that the stakes became higher than they would have been if the number of elements remaining to be discovered had been uncertain, as they were in pre-Moseley times. Element 72 (fig. 4.1) was clearly anticipated, although not as such, even in Mendeleev’s earliest table of 1869. As fig. 4.2 shows, Mendeleev considered that an as yet undiscovered element with an atomic weight of 180 should be a homologue of zirconium (The modern accepted value is 178.50). This fact may not seem very significant and yet we will see, as the story of this chapter unfolds, that it amounts to Mendeleev predicting that this element would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth. But Mendeleev was not really in a position to make such a statement since the nature and number of rare earth elements was unknown in his day. Indeed, the problem of the rare earths was one of the most acute challenges to his periodic system and one that he personally never resolved. Sometime later, Julius Thomsen, a chemistry professor at the University of Copenhagen and incidentally the chemistry instructor to the physicist Niels Bohr, published a periodic table in which he too included a missing element that was a homologue of zirconium (fi g. 4.3). Suffice it to say that there was a general consensus among chemists that on the basis of the periodic table there should exist an element before tantalum that would be a homologue of zirconium.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}
{"title": "Hybrid Cu-Carbon as Interconnect Materials and Their Interconnect Models", "abstract": "Carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoribbons, are well-known viable solutions for next-generation interconnect applications. When compared to copper interconnects, carbon nanomaterials have a longer mean free path (MFP), higher ampacity, and higher thermal conductivity. It should be noted that even with today's state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, the assumption of tightly packed CNTs is crude. Furthermore, even with state-of-the-art technology, the thickness of multilayer graphene nanoribbons cannot meet the criteria, particularly for global interconnect levels. Also, as the number of layers grows, graphene begins to act more like graphite. Because these revolutionary solutions are still in their infancy, the traditional Cu/low-k connection technology is currently the most foreseeable option for near-term technology nodes. Copper-carbon nanotube (Cu-CNT) composites, which combine copper and carbon nanotubes, are expected to replace copper interconnect in the near future. CNTs are supposed to play three major roles in Cu-CNT composites: (1) their contribution to the composite in terms of their exceptional nanoscale multi-functional properties improves its performance; (2) CNTs act as weight reducers, making the composite lighter; and (3) Cu-CNT composite interconnects are more compatible with CMOS fabrication processes than CNTs due to their rectangular structure and better interface with the contacts. Copper-graphene (Cu-GNR) hybrid interconnects, in which copper is enclosed by a few layers of graphene that serve as a barrier layer, are also being investigated as a copper interconnect replacement in the near future. As a barrier layer, graphene expands the grain size of Cu, reducing grain boundary scattering and lowering the resistivity of copper-graphene (Cu-GNR) hybrid interconnects. Cu lines with graphene as a barrier layer not only have geometrical advantages, but they also provide a low-resistance parallel conducting channel for signal conduction. In terms of crosstalk latency, graphene barrier layer is 56% more effective than cobalt, according to our calculations. Graphene as a barrier layer offers great promise due to its outstanding thermal and electrical conductivity. An improvement in existing hybrid structures (Cu-CNT composite and Cu-GNR hybrid interconnects) is proposed in the form of a new construction that integrates copper, graphene, and carbon nanotubes as a hybrid interconnect structure. Cu-GNR hybrid interconnects are well recognized for adding strength to copper interconnects as a barrier layer, improving dependability. Because of their superior conductivity, Cu-CNT composite interconnects are also advised to replace copper interconnects. In comparison to Cu-GNR and Cu-CNT composite interconnects, the unique Cu-carbon hybrid interconnect takes advantage of both increased reliability and conductivity from both structures. Figure 7.1 depicts the structural differences between existing hybrid interconnect structures (Cu-GNR hybrid and Cu-CNT composite) and the novel Cu-carbon hybrid interconnect structure. This structure was recently fabricated and proved to exhibit excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties, which led to overall performance improvement.

By developing and applying a model that couples atomistic to mesoscopic scales, the major outcomes of this basic research project are: (i) the systematic analysis of deformation and failure mechanisms in biological hierarchical structures (such as bone and spider silk), (ii) the development of designs for heterogeneous materials involving variations in hierarchical structure and topology for damage tolerance, (iii) the development of multiscale models describing the mechanics of materials with disordered heterogeneous distributions of mechanical properties with the potential of uncertainty quantification of fracture properties, and (iv) the development of a hierarchical model that captures deformation mechanisms at multiple hierarchical levels, resulting in hierarchical Ashby deformation mechanism design maps. The project also aims at developing methods to realize physical samples for testing, which reflect the designed geometries. This project addressed a critical frontier in engineering science, the optimization of nanostructure, mesostructure and topological features for failure properties. Whereas structural optimization at larger length-scales has been employed earlier, a systematic investigation of the adaptation of hierarchical nanostructures for failure properties under extreme mechanical loading has not been reported. Moreover, a novel approach offers the possibility of characterizing uncertainties in material properties with the view towards a rigorous risk assessment of the fracture response of advanced hierarchical composites.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}
{"title": "Hardness, Stiffness and Toughness of Particles", "abstract": "Hardness, stiffness and toughness represent the resistance of solid materials to plastic and elastic deformations and crack propagation, respectively. The indentation hardness and constraint factor depend on the properties of the deformed material, the indenter geometry, and the coefficient of friction. For materials which exhibit significant work-hardening, the hardness is much larger than the yield stress. This is because hardness is conventionally measured at a strain of about 8%, where significant work-hardening can take place. Measurement and theory of hardness testing have been developed in the field of material testing, where it has been possible to carry out hardness tests on relatively large specimens. The measurement of hardness started with scratch testing of flat surfaces by various particles having varying degree of hardness, i.e. Mohs hardness test. Fracture toughness represents the resistance of solid materials to crack propagation.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

The composition of the alloy materials was based on a generalized formulation to process various proposed feed streams resulting from the processing of used fuel. Waste elements are introduced into molten steel during alloy fabrication and, upon solidification, become incorporated into durable iron-based intermetallic phases of the alloy waste form. The first alloy ingot contained surrogate (non-radioactive), transition-metal fission products with rhenium acting as a surrogate for technetium. The second alloy ingot contained the same components as the first ingot, but included radioactive Tc-99 instead of rhenium. Understanding technetium behavior in the waste form is of particular importance due the longevity of Tc-99 and its mobility in the biosphere in the oxide form. RAW-1(Re) and RAW-1(Tc) are currently being used as test specimens in the comprehensive testing program investigating the corrosion and radionuclide release mechanisms of the representative alloy waste form. Also described in this report is the experimental plan to study the effects of reducing atmospheres and reducing additives to the alloy material during fabrication in an attempt to maximize the oxide content of waste streams that can be accommodated in the alloy waste form. Activities described in the experimental plan will be performed in FY12. The first aspect of the experimental plan is to study oxide formation on the alloy by introducing O2 impurities in the melt cover gas or from added oxide impurities in the feed materials. Reducing atmospheres will then be introduced to the melt cover gas in an attempt to minimize oxide formation during alloy fabrication.

Raman spectroscopy has been shown to exhibit isotopic shifts if a given molecular vibration involves the isotope of interest. Both techniques are comprised of the same basic hardware: a spectrometer, a laser system (pulsed for LAMIS, pulsed or CW for Raman), and an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD). Shifts in Raman spectra due to lithium isotopes in Li2C03 and LiOH*H20 were observed.

Viologens-based Electrochromic Materials and Devices", "abstract": "Viologens, or 1,1′-disubstituted-4,4′-bipyridiniums, are electrochromic materials with dramatic color change when reduced from transparent dication to colored radical cation. Many applications based on viologens have been developed, including anti-glare mirrors or displays in which viologens could be used to offer optical contrast. Additionally, by substituting different groups on bipyridiniums, the optical characteristics of viologens upon reduction could be tuned, such as alkyl for blue or aryl for green, which expands the versatility of viologens for displays. In an electrochromic device, viologens could be classified into three types of electrochromes depending on the environment or mechanism: type-1 for viologens in non-aqueous solvents, type-2 for precipitated viologens at radical cation state, and type-3 for immobilized viologens. Among them, type-3 viologen electrochromes are most known for their stability improved by immobilizing viologens, and therefore they were widely adopted in commercial electrochromic devices.

The joint strength was estimated using T-peel tests and the treated surfaces were characterized using ATR-IR spectroscopy, contact angle measurements (water, ethanediol), and SEM. Different experimental variables were considered in the study: The length of the treatment, the reaction time, the neutralization of the treated surface with and without ammonium hydroxide, and the concentration of the sulfuric acid. The treatment of S0 rubber with sulfuric acid produced an increase in surface energy which was mainly ascribed to an increase in the polar component of the surface energy. The treatment produced several chemical modifications on the rubber surface, mainly the creation of sulfonic acid moieties and the creation of C=C bonds. The treatment created conjugated C=C bonds and cracks on the rubber surface which became deeper and wider as the length of the treatment increased. The treatment with sulfuric acid was not restricted to the surface but a bulk modification was also produced (decrease in tensile strength and elongation-at-break). The treatment enhanced the T-peel strength of S0 rubber/polyurethane adhesive joints, and the locus of failure was mainly mixed (adhesional + cohesive failure in the rubber). The optimum conditions for the treatment of S0 rubber were a treatment time of 0.25–1 min, a reaction time of 0.5–1 min, neutralization with ammonium hydroxide and the concentration of the sulfuric acid 95 wt%.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

These graphene nanosheets were used to synthesize polyaniline/graphene nanocomposites with chemical oxidation of aniline monomer via in-situ emulsion polymerization in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate in acid media. Morphological studies confirmed that graphene nanosheets were prepared successfully with this chemical reduction method. Electrical conductivity of synthesized polymer and nanocomposites investigated using a standard four-point probe technique. Electrical conductivity, FTIR and UV-Vis investigation confirmed that conductive binary doped emeraldine salt polyaniline and its nanocomposites with graphene nanosheets should be synthesized via emulsion polymerization. Morphological studies illustrated that this conductive powder, which was designated as PAG, has almost spherical shape with size of about 10-20 nm. We used it to fabricate novel porous-conductive scaffolds composed of chitosan and gelatin via lyophilization method. Conductivity measurements of the scaffolds revealed that with low amount of PAG (~2.5 wt.%) the conductivity reached close to 10-3 S.cm-1, which was suitable for tissue engineering applications. Pore and swelling behavior studies showed porous scaffolds with porosity more than 50% and the pore size between 10-70 µ, with ability of absorbing more than 200% water, had successfully produced by freeze-drying process. The main mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, elongation at break point and tensile modulus of the scaffolds were examined in both dry and hydrated states.

The sensor combines three modes of selectivity (electrochemistry, spectroscopy, and selective partitioning) into a single sensor to substantially improve selectivity. The sensor consists of a basic spectroelectrochemical configuration that we have developed under our previous DOE grants: a waveguide with an optically transparent electrode (OTE) that is coated with a thin chemically-selective film that preconcnetrates the analyte. The key to adapting this generic sensor to detect TcO4- and Tc complexes lies in the development of chemically-selective films that preconcentrate the analyte and, when necessary, chemically convert it into a complex with electrochemical and spectroscopic properties appropriate for sensing. Significant accomplishments were made in the general areas of synthesis and characterization of polymer films that efficiently preconcentrate the analyte, development and characterization of sensors and associated instrumentation, and synthesis and characterization of relevant Re and Tc complexes. Two new polymer films for the preconcentration step in the sensor were developed: partially sulfonated polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SSEBS) and phosphine containing polymer films. The latter was a directed polymer film synthesis that combined the proper electrostatic properties to attract TcO4- and also incorporated a suitable ligand for covalently trapping a lower oxidation state Tc complex within the film for spectroelectrochemical detection. Spectroelectrochemical sensors were developed and demonstrated, first using [Re(dmpe)3]+ (dmpe = 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane) as a model compound with the non-radioactive Re surrogate for radioactive Tc. A fluorescence based spectroelectrochemical sensor for [Tc(dmpe)3]+/2+was then developed using SSEBS as the preconcentrating film. Portable instrumentation for the fluorescence spectroelectrochemical sensor was fabricated and tested. The effects of components in Hanford subsurface water on sensor performance with a detailed evaluation of the effect of total ionic strength on sensitivity demonstrated the ability to use the spectroelectrochemical sensor on representative water samples. A variety Re and Tc complexes were synthesized and characterized to explore the best ligands to use for detection of Tc. A lower oxidation-state Tc-complex [Tc(dmpe)3]+ (dmpe = 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane) was synthesized to use as a model compound for developing Tc sensors. [Tc(dmpe)3]+/2+ exhibited the important properties of solution fluorescence at ambient temperatures and reversible electrochemistry. A range of low oxidation state dioxo Re- and Tc-complexes of formulae [ReO2(py)4]+, [ReO2(CN)4]-, [ReO2(P-P)2]+ and [ReO2(S-S)2]+ (py = pyridine) were synthesized. An exhaustive study of the spectroscopy and electrochemistry of Re(diimine)(CO)3(halide) complexes was performed. These complexes served as models for the Tc(diimine)(CO)3(halide) complexes that were readily formed from Tc(CO)x(halides)6-x complexes which are themselves constituents of tank waste samples from Hanford. Of particular interest were new Tc complexes with the +5 and +6 oxidation states. Tetrabutylammonium salt of tetrachlorooxotechnetate(V), (nBu4N)[TcOCl4] (I) was synthesized and the structure determined. [TcO2(CN)4]3- , [TcO2(en)2]2+ , [TcO2(im)4]+, and [TcO2(py)4]+ (en = ethylenediamine; im = imidazole; py = pyridine) complexes were synthesized and solution and solid state 99Tc NMR spectra were acquired giving the opportunity of determining electric field gradient (EFG) and shielding tensors for a transition metal center with a partially filled d shell.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

{"title": "The contribution of low carbon steel to the decarbonization of the building sector", "abstract": "The building sector is responsible for about 40% of carbon emissions, in which about 11% are related to embodied carbon emissions. Therefore, buildings play an important role to the carbon neutrality of the construction sector, and the use of low-carbon materials is an added-value towards this goal. This paper aims to highlight the contribution of low-carbon steel buildings to the reduction of embodied carbon emissions in the building sector. The study entails a comparative life cycle assessment of a steel building using standard carbon steel and a building made of low-carbon steel. The comparative analysis entails the complete life cycle of the building, from the construction stage to the recycling stage, including Module D. As expected, the results show that the low-carbon steel has as a lower impact in the production stage when compared with the standard steel. However, in the end-of-life stage, the result is the opposite as the net credits allocated in Module D are in this case a burden. Nevertheless, in terms of the whole LCA result, the life cycle result of the low-carbon steel is about 24% lower when compared with the standard carbon steel.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}
{"title": "Electrospun Nanofibers in Tissue Engineering", "abstract": "The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is a fast growing scientific field. Many diseases and injuries that result in the loss of organ or tissue functions currently lack treatments which restore those functions and the patient to a desirable quality of life. Many current treatments could greatly benefit from incorporation of bioengineered organs and tissues, and investigation into this field shows great promise for modern medicine. Tissue engineering hypothesizes that by incorporating appropriate cells in the context of a threedimensional scaffold and then implanting the cell-scaffold construct into an injury or defect, that the cells and scaffold will provide both active and passive healing properties. Various scaffolding systems exist and are generally made from natural and/or synthetic polymers. Scaffolds can be fabricated by many methods including solvent casting and particulate leaching, melt molding, rapid prototyping, phase separation, and many others (Yang et al., 2001). Of particular interest to the subject of nanofibers is electrospinning, which has seen widespread use in the field of tissue engineering due to the ease of use, scalability, adaptability, and capacity to form fibers on both the micro and nano scale (Sill & von Recum, 2008). In constructing scaffolds for tissue engineering it is ideal to provide cells with an environment which closely resembles their native extracellular matrix (ECM). The spinning of nanofibers allows for a connected and porous scaffold which can mimic the ECM of many tissue types structurally, chemically, and mechanically. The ECM is a largely proteinaceous cellular environment that varies greatly between tissue types. In most tissue types the ECM is composed of a highly interconnected network of proteins such as collagen and elastin, and proteoglycans such as perlecan (Lodish et al., 2008). These molecules link together to form a functional environment in which cells live, move, receive and transmit signals, and which provides structural support to the cells, tissue, and organ as a whole. The composition of molecules in the ECM has a strong influence on the structural properties of the tissue which it helps compose. For example, in tissues which must stretch and bend, such as the muscle of the heart, elastin is a necessary ECM component which lends elasticity to the tissue when found in sufficient quantities (Lodish et al., 2008). Similar examples may be found in all tissue types, exemplifying the common theme of structure supplying function found throughout biology. The ECM is approximately nano scale and fibrous, though the fiber orientation depends on the tissue type. For example, dermis has randomly oriented fibers so as to provide structural support when stretched in different directions, while ligaments have a highly directional ECM so as to provide support in the direction of stress.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

These new nanomaterials will play a critical role in meeting the 21st century grand challenges of the US, including energy diversity and sustainability, national security and economic competitiveness. The goal of this work was to develop and fundamentally validate methods of directed selfassembly of nanomaterials and nanodispersion processing. The specific aims were: 1. Nanocolloid self-assembly and interactions in AC electric fields. In an effort to reduce the particle sizes used in AC electric field self-assembly to lengthscales, we propose detailed characterizations of field-driven structures and studies of the fundamental underlying particle interactions. We will utilize microscopy and light scattering to assess order-disorder transitions and self-assembled structures under a variety of field and physicochemical conditions. Optical trapping will be used to measure particle interactions. These experiments will be synergetic with calculations of the particle polarizability, enabling us to both validate interactions and predict the order-disorder transition for nanocolloids. 2. Assembly of anisotropic nanocolloids. Particle shape has profound effects on structure and flow behavior of dispersions, and greatly complicates their processing and self-assembly. The methods developed to study the self-assembled structures and underlying particle interactions for dispersions of isotropic nanocolloids will be extended to systems composed of anisotropic particles.

{"title": "Nanosized Hybrid Polymer Modifiers (HPM) for Improved Mechanical and Thermal Behavior of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites", "abstract": "Lightweight carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites are replacing metallic components due to improved strength-to- weight ratios and fatigue resistance. However, they crack and delaminate due to low-velocity impact reducing their mechanical properties. Some of the approaches include surface modification of carbon fibers and addition of graphene or graphene oxide nanoparticles, improving resistance to crack propagation and reduces delamination. Graphene oxide (GO) can achieve excellent dispersion with polymer matrices due to functional groups compatible with composite matrix systems. Prior research from our group demonstrated successful grafting of GO with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) to optimize the thermal stability of GO. Due to cage-like structure of POSS, dispersion of these hybrid nanoparticles within polymer matrices could result in an enhancement in mechanical and thermal behavior of composite materials. Methacryl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (MAPOSS) molecules were hybridized to GO to MEGO and characterized. The dispersion of HPM was studied in thermoset resin system Epon 862 Epoxy. In addition, the effect of HPM on polymer and carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite were studied. Results confirmed that the addition of HPM at very low wt.% can enhance the viscoelastic, mechanical, and thermal properties of composites.

The water content in the hydrogel fibers of HPB-PEG derivatives can be controlled by the substitution pattern of the amphiphile and by the length of the PEG chains. The fiber formation is verified by light scattering and TEM.

In dealing with an electron-phonon system it is reasonably realistic to approximate the effects of the phonons by an effective interaction between electrons that is of short range in space and retarded in time. It is especially appropriate to study the Green's function method in connection with the theory of superconductivity, because there are two reasons for this. The superconductor is the first system in solid-state physics in which the interaction between electrons qualitatively changes the spectrum of excitations. The other reason is the interaction that causes superconductivity is not describable by an ordinary potential: An electronic charge fluctuation with a frequency just below a characteristic frequency of the ionic lattice excites in the lattice a resonant sympathetic vibration that overcompensates for the electronic charge.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}
{"title": "Ionic Liquid-based Surfactants: A Step Forward", "abstract": "Ionic liquid-based surfactants are a group of ionic liquid derivatives capable of forming micellar aggregates when dissolved in water above a certain concentration, known as the critical micelle concentration (CMC). This new class of surfactants was initially obtained by incorporating long alkyl chain substituents within the charged cationic group of conventional monocationic IL structures. More recently, dicationic, tricationic, and functionalized IL-based surfactants have been described. IL-based surfactants present great tuneability as original ILs: simple modifications in their structures produce important variations in their micellar properties. Furthermore, micelles formed by IL-based surfactants exhibit lower CMC values than conventional cationic surfactants when comparing similar structures. It is important to characterize the micellization and interfacial behaviour of IL-based surfactants in order to apply them successfully in specific fields. Several techniques can be used for such characterization, such as surface tension, fluorescence and conductivity measurements. Due to their structural versatility and singular properties, IL-based surfactants have generated a great deal of interest, which is reflected in the increasing number of applications that have been reported in recent years. Among the main applications of IL-based surfactants, worthy of mention are biomedicine, catalysis, solvents, nanotechnology, and separation science fields.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

Development of cost-competitive materials for catalysis and hydrogen storage on-board motor vehicles is crucial to lead subsequent generations into a more sustainable and energy independent future. This thesis presents work toward the scalable synthesis of bimetallic heterostructures that can enable hydrogen to compete with carbonaceous fuels by meeting the necessary gravimetric and volumetric energy densities and by enhancing hydrogen sorption/desorption kinetics near ambient temperatures and pressures. Utilizing the well-known phenomenon of hydrogen spillover, these bimetallic heterostructures could work by lowering the activation energy for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of metals. Herein, we report a novel method for the scalable synthesis of silica templated zero-valent nickel particles (Ni$\\subset$ SiO2) that hold promise for the synthesis of nickel nanorods for use in bimetallic heterostructures for hydrogen storage. Our synthesis proceeds by chemical reduction of a nickel-hydrazine complex with sodium borohydride followed by calcination under hydrogen gas to yield silica encapsulated nickel particles. Transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the general morphology of the resultant nanocapsules as well as the crystalline phases of the incorporated Ni0 nanocrystals. The structures display strong magnetic behavior at room temperature and preliminary data suggests nickel particle size can be controlled by varying the amount of nickel precursor used in the synthesis. Calcination under different environments and TEM analysis provides evidence for an atomic migration mechanism of particle formation. Ni$\\subset$SiO2 nanocapsules were used as seeds to induce heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent growth within the nanocapsule via electroless nickel plating. Nickel nanoparticle growth occurs under high temperature alkaline conditions, however silica nanocapsule integrity is not maintained due to the incompatibility of silica with the growth conditions. Silica nanocapsule integrity is maintained under low temperature neutral conditions, but nickel particle growth is not observed. Through FTIR and UV/Vis analysis, we show the degree of crosslinking and condensation increases in calcined silica compared to as-synthesized silica. We propose the increased density of the silica nanocapsule hinders mass transfer of the bulky nickel precursor complex from solution and onto the surface of the “catalytic” zero-valent nickel seed within the nanocapsule cavity. Decreasing the density of the silica nanocapsule can be achieved through co-condensation of tetraethylorthosilicate with an alkyl functionalized silane followed by calcination to remove the organic component or by chemical etching in alkaline solution, but will not be addressed in this thesis.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

{"title": "Effect of thermal aging and irradiation on microstructure and crack growth response of Alloy 690", "abstract": "Nickel-base Alloy 690 and the associated weld Alloys 52 and 152 are typically used for nozzle penetrations in replacement heads for pressurized water reactor (PWR) vessels, because of their excellent overall resistance to general corrosion and environmental degradation, primarily stress corrosion cracking (SCC). However, many of the existing PWRs reactors are expected to operate for 40-80 years. Likewise, advanced water-cooled small modular reactors (SMRs) will use Ni-Cr alloys and are expected to receive initial operating licenses for 60 years. Hence, the thermal stability of Ni-Cr alloys is a potential concern for the long-term performance of both existing and advanced nuclear plants, and possibly spent fuel storage containers. The objective of this research is to understand the microstructural changes occurring in high-Cr, Ni-based Alloy 690 during long time exposure to the reactor operating temperatures, and the effect of these changes on the service performance. One area of particular concern is the potential for long range ordering (LRO), i.e. formation of the intermetallic Ni2Cr phase under prolonged exposure to reactor temperatures and/or irradiation, which can increase strength, decrease ductility, and cause dimensional changes or lead to in-service embrittlement of components made with these alloys. Hence, this research focused on the microstructural evolution and the SCC response of Alloy 690 under accelerated thermal aging and irradiation conditions. The materials studied involved Alloy 690 from two sources: (i) Alloy 690 plate from an Alloy 152 dissimilar metal weld (DMW) joining the Alloy 690 plate to Alloy 533 LAS, aged at three different temperatures (370°C, 400°C and 450°C) for up to 75,000h (equivalent to 60 years of service), and (ii) specimens neutron-irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor up to 40 dpa. For aged Alloy 690 specimens, hardness was found to increase with aging time, however, the microstructural characterization by means of synchrotron X-ray did not find evidence of LRO. The microstructural characterization of neutron-irradiated specimens by TEM found no evidence of LRO either. Testing in a primary water environment of Alloy 690 specimens aged to a 60-year service equivalent revealed a fatigue and corrosion fatigue crack growth responses similar to those measured on the un-aged alloy. The SCC CGR response was also low. Overall, the two Alloy 690 heats investigated in this work, aged up to 60-year service equivalents or exposed to neutron irradiation up to 40 dpa, did not exhibit a deterioration in microstructure or performance.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

The stem of kenaf comprises of two major parts; bast and core, that are distinctly different in term of anatomy, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties; the fibrous outer bark or bast and woody inner core. The chemical composition of kenaf is quite similar to that of wood, except for the ash content, which is relatively higher.

Due to their relatively large size, however, themicrospheres were not appropriate to direct the drug to target tissues or cellsvia systemic circulation or across the mucous membrane [1-3]. Nanoparticles,instead, were successfully used for systemic, oral, pulmonary, transdermal andother administration routes for various purposes including drug targeting,enhancement of drug bio-availability and protection of drug bioactivity andstability [4-6]. Also, nanoparticles can improve the bioavailability of poorlyabsorbed drugs, thus enhancing oral delivery [3, 4]. Moreover, the nanoparticlesare able to permeate cells for cellular internalisation and connective tissuepermeation and so deliver the drug efficiently to the targeted tissue withoutclogging capillaries [7, 8]. The ability of nanoparticles to improve drug diffusionthrough biological barriers is a typical benefit for the delivery of anticanceragents. The enhanced endocytic activity and leaky vasculature in the tumorcould result in accumulation of intravenously administered nanoparticles [9].Some studies have indicated that nanoparticle-bound antitumour agents showedprolonged drug retention in tumours, reduction in tumour growth and prolongedsurvival of tumour-bearing animals [10-13].", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}
{"title": "Liposome-Scaffold Systems for Drug Delivery", "abstract": "The combination of liposomes and scaffolds can afford unprecedented functional and safety enhancements to the delivery of drugs, protein therapeutics, or genes. For instance, local delivery of liposome-encapsulated biomolecules can maintain appropriate drug levels at a healing site, thereby reducing adverse side effects associated with continued bolus administration. Although liposomes have been extensively demonstrated to be attractive carriers for therapeutically active agents, they suffer from drawbacks, which have significantly limited their widespread use. The most attractive and, so far, therapeutically promising, feature of combining tissue-engineered scaffolds with liposomes for enhanced delivery of bioactive molecules is the ability to control delivery in a sustained and targeted manner. Incorporating liposomes inside polymeric matrices generates functionally diverse two-component systems that enhance therapeutic cargo delivery. For pharmaceutical delivery, the ability of incorporating liposomes within hydrogels enables the entrapment and delivery of hydrophobic drugs.

{"title": "Nanofertilizers for Sustainable Agriculture", "abstract": "The present scenario of mushrooming the global population amidst the rising changes in the climate has put humongous stress on the agriculture production system. To alleviate food grain demands dependence on fertilizers increased. Over the decades, excessive use of fertilizers began to adversely affect the environment. Agriculture is the backbone of every economy, especially the developing countries like India. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies for improving food security while maintaining the sustainability of the environment would always be appreciated. Nanotechnology has emerged as an innovative solution that has brought numerous developments to the agriculture sector such as nanofertilizers, nanoherbicides, nano biosensors, etc. The nanoscale (1-100 nm) property imparts special characteristics such as enhanced surface area, etc. to the material thereby reducing the dependence on bulky conventional fertilizers. The low nutrient-use efficiency of traditional fertilizers has long been a barrier in production systems, as crop responsiveness to additional fertilizers has begun to deteriorate. Low uptake efficiency of the conventional fertilizers due to their vulnerability to losses by runoff, volatilization, leaching, fixation, etc. are the primary reasons for increased environmental degradation. The result is excess nutrient mining from the soil profile leading to net negative soil nutrient balance. Nanofertilizers are a potential sector that might improve nutrient-use efficiency while posing minimal environmental risk in order to feed the world's expanding population, which just surpassed 8 billion people. They are capable of supplying the nutrients in controlled amounts and under varied environmental conditions to promote productivity in a sustainable manner along with improving the environmental quality through smart delivery mechanisms.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

After the introduction of nitroxide stable radicals by diffusion to orient with different degree polymer films, the samples were tested by noted method via the definition of the measuring of correlation times of rotation of stable radicals around their axes. It is established that the free radicals concentration and their correlation time in local regions of the films are the lower, the higher is the orientation (stretching) degree of the films, which directly is connected with the volume of micro-empties in the polymer matrix. Noted processes correlate with analogical ones in the same polymer containing high dispersive electrical conducting filler (carbon black). In this case, the diffusion of free radicals to the polymer matrix is more difficult than in pure polymer–the significances of correlation time, and diffusion coefficients of stable radicals decrease because of additive interactions of these radicals with filler particles.

This could cause a continual inflammatory response and lead to health problems associated with metal compounds or metal ions, especially if such chemistries become separated in particulate form from the bulk metal during use. Recently, research groups have introduced a new classification of metals with nanoscale particulate or grain sizes to decrease traditional metal toxicity, eliminate infection without using antibiotics, reduce inflammation, kill cancer cells, and increase tissue growth. Findings are presented with a mechanistic understanding of how cells recognize and respond favorably to nanomaterials.

{"title": "High temperature ceramic heat exchanger for solid oxide fuel cell", "abstract": "A ceramic heat exchanger with high effectiveness and low-pressure drop has been developed for application as a cathode air preheater for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). At the operating conditions of SOFCs, typical metallic alloys as those used in commercial heat exchangers may undergo chromium volatilization, which is a known cathode degradation mechanism that reduces SOFC performance and life. Use of ceramics such as alumina or alumina-silicate instead of chromium-containing metal is one approach to eliminate the effects of chromium on the SOFC cathode. This project leverages the geometric design of a heat exchanger previously prototyped and tested [1] to fabricate a novel heat exchanger made from a ceramic material. All calculations of heat exchanger performance requirements are based on state of the art SOFC operating conditions. The alumina-silicate material selected to fabricate the modular prototype heat exchanger was made via a heat transfer based trade-off analysis that shows that for low pressure-drop devices, flow convection is the limiting heat transfer mechanism, and therefore wall conductivity becomes less relevant to heat transfer effectiveness. The modular design presented allows for incremental aggregation of modules to target a broad range of operating conditions typical of present and upcoming SOFC applications (e.g., 25 to 400 kWe). The completed prototype was subjected to a series of static leak/pressure tests, dynamic pressure drop tests both at ambient and realistic service temperature conditions, and finally to a matrix of heat transfer experiments to fully characterize its heat transfer effectiveness (including tests at hot gas temperatures up to 1033 K or 1400oF). The stand-alone system was demonstrated in the laboratory to successfully satisfy the design criteria at realistic operating conditions, showing a total pressure drop at the design flow of 8 g/sec of 6 kPa (vs. 3.45 kPa approximate requirement). It was also shown to have heat transfer effectiveness of 76% (with 73% being the design requirement). Moreover, the unit was shown to operate leak-free, and the ceramic elements and seals were capable of withstanding the thermal cycling resulting from the testing procedure. The heat exchanger was then integrated into a modified fuel cell test stand and tested at steady state operation. Unfortunately, the level of performance achieved was lower than expected based on laboratory performance tests. This appears to have been the result of an unforeseen loosening of a heat exchanger structural component, which resulted into a leak that prevented proper supply of hot gas to the heat exchanger. However, in general terms, the heat exchanger/fuel cell integration process provides confidence that a future application of the unit with a SOFC is feasible, assuming structural issues are addressed. It is considered that the difficulties encountered at the last stage of the program provided invaluable input in locating shortcomings of the mechanical design and integration approach.

{"title": "Advancement in Packaging Technologies for Agri-Food Sector", "abstract": "Globalization has increased the consumer's demand for safe and quality foods. To make food available to consumers from farm to fork, packaging plays a crucial role. The objective of packaging is to shield the foodstuff from degrading and to serve as the medium of communication between the processing industry and the consumers. Conventionally, several materials are used in the packaging such as laminates, plastics, glass, metal, etc., but with the advent of technology, newer and novel smart packaging technologies have entered this field. Smart packaging in the form of active and intelligent packaging not only acts as a barrier to external influences but also prevents internal deterioration. Oxygen scavengers, moisture controllers, antioxidants, CO2 absorber/emitter, antimicrobial agents, etc., are some of the vital active packaging systems. On the other hand, an intelligent packaging system contains internal or external indicators and sensors that monitor the condition of packed food and gives information about its quality during storage and transportation. It seems that these interventions in packaging have very positive effects on the whole industry, but it is observed that this advancement in the packaging has also raised questions about its disposal. To overcome this issue, industries have started using smart packaging design along with the sustainable packaging trend. Communication with the recycling bodies at the time of development will ensure the smart packaging fit to be recycled. Considering such standards for smart packaging will not only create a healthy bond between industries and consumers but will also help in sustainable development.

{"title": "Nanophytomedicine and Their Applications", "abstract": "Nowadays, phytoconstituents are receiving significant attention due to their impeccable ability to treat almost all disease conditions, such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ischemic stroke, atherosclerosis, chronic wounds, diabetes mellitus, obesity, etc. Some common phytoconstituents widely recognized for their efficient biomedical applications include resveratrol, curcumin, berberine, apigenin, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, and so on. Although these phytochemicals are cost-effective, with relatively fewer side effects than synthetic chemicals, their therapeutic efficacy is not greater than many synthetic chemicals. One of the primary reasons behind these issues is poor bioavailability, short half-life, poor stability in environmental and physiological conditions, lack of prolonged effect, and no targeting ability. Nanotechnology has emerged in recent years in the quest to overcome these drawbacks. Nanotechnology involves the engineering of nanomaterials in the nanosize range. Among many nanomaterials, polymer-based NPs have grasped the attention due to their ability to achieve controlled and targeted drug delivery, long-term stability, and biocompatibility. In addition, the scale-up of these NPs is straightforward compared to other NPs. In this contemplate, the present chapter describes different types of polymer-based NPs.

Multiferroics are prime prospects for numerous technological applications, comprising actuators, information storage devices, and spintronic devices, due to their ability to switch polarization with magnetic field and magnetization with electric field. The hunt for novel materials due to technological significance of these kinds of materials has led to continuous efforts to exhibit both magnetic and electric ordering in a single phase. Successful synthesis of NdFeO3-PbTiO3 ceramic has been achieved by solid-state reaction-based, and its multiferroic properties have been examined. The sample exhibits a tetragonal structural phase with space group P4mm, according to X-ray diffractograms and Rietveld refinement.

Based on a comprehensive microstructure and property screening performed in Phase-1 of the ARRM program, a total of five alloys, together with 316L and X-750 as references, were down-selected for Phase-2 neutron irradiation studies. Because thermal aging could exert a synergistic effect on neutron irradiation due to the low neutron damage rate on the order of 10–7 displacements per atom per second (dpa/s), Grade 92 (one of the five down-selected alloys) and two heats of 316L were selected in this task to study the effect of aging at 350°C for 12.5–12.7 kh on microstructure and mechanical properties. The aging time is approximately corresponding to 5 dpa neutron irradiation, which can be served as a reference for the 5-dpa-irradiated samples of the alloys to help understand the independent neutron damage influence on microstructure and mechanical properties. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used for microstructural characterization. Hardness, tensile, Charpy impact toughness, and fracture toughness in the ductile regime of the aged samples were examined. The aging of Grade 92 led to the formation of many Laves phase in sizes of ~100–200 nm and resulted in some reduction in hardness and yield/ultimate tensile strength with some increases in uniform and total plastic elongations, which may have helped the enhancement of Charpy impact toughness, e.g., ~4 J increase in upper-shelf energy and 20.5°C reduction in ductile-brittle transition temperature compared with the unaged condition. The fracture toughness of the aged Grade 92 showed decent toughness of ~303 MPa√m (KJq) with ~87 tearing modulus at 22°C, which reduced to ~241 MPa√m (~20% reduction) with ~75 tearing modulus at 300°C. The two heats of 316L are differentiated by their amounts of δ-ferrite, i.e., ~1 vol% in heat T1103 and ~4 vol% in heat N5B8. The two heats of 316L were subjected to 15% cold work (CW) as this condition is often used in nuclear reactors to help trapping radiation-induced defects and thus postpone the steady state swelling stage. The aging did not result in any noticeable microstructure changes, except for possible segregations at grain boundaries that need to be further investigated. The aging resulted in slight reduction in hardness of 316L-T1103 and slight increase in hardness of 316L-N5B8, which is consistent with their tensile testing results. The 15%CW might have introduced some inhomogeneity, resulting in large standard deviations in hardness, which were reduced after the aging. The aged 316L followed the same trend as the unaged condition for the strength and elongation results from the tensile testing. Minimum elongations appeared within ~300–600°C, above which the elongations seem to increase. Unlike the negligible or minor changes in microstructure, hardness and tensile results of the two heats of 316L, their fracture toughness showed noticeable difference. The aged 316L-T1103 showed good toughness of ~350 MPa√m with ~80 tearing modulus at 22°C, which reduced to ~271 MPa√m (~23% reduction) with ~83 tearing modulus at 300°C. In contrast, the aged 316L-N5B8 showed lower toughness of ~244 MPa√m with ~53 tearing modulus at 22°C, which reduced to ~180 MPa√m (~26% reduction) with ~31 tearing modulus at 300°C. The preliminary results indicate that the presence of high volume of δ-ferrite would noticeable impair fracture toughness although it may not influence hardness and tensile properties.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

DESI works better with polar analytes that are easy to protonate or deprotonate, whereas DAPPI is often used to ionize nonpolar or neutral compounds. DART produces relatively simple mass spectra dominated by protonated molecules in the positive ion mode or deprotonated molecules in the negative ion mode.

{"title": "Broken Adjustable Moore Pins Made From Cobalt-Chromium Alloy", "abstract": "Abstract Two of four adjustable Moore pins, which had been used to stabilize a proximal femur fracture, were found to be broken and deformed at their threads. The pins were made from a cobalt-chromium alloy and were not in the same condition. Brittle precipitates in the grains and grain boundaries were seen in one of the pins and hence the fracture was revealed to have occurred along the grain boundaries. The other pin made from cold-worked cobalt-chromium alloy was observed to have randomly lines of primary inclusions. Intermingled dimples and fatigue striations were exhibited on the fracture surface of this pin. Thus, the effect of different conditions of cobalt-chromium alloys on failure behavior was demonstrated as a result of this study.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

{"title": "Other Arylene-Based Polymers", "abstract": "This chapter discusses how to tune the orbital energy levels and bandgaps of copolymers containing arylene and/or heteroarylene units, so as to obtain materials for high efficiency LEDs, TFTs and OPVs. By careful selection of the structures, and optimisation of the molar masses, polymers have been made which show very high charge carrier mobilities due to efficient charge transport. Here control of the solid-state packing is important but high crystallinity does not seem to be necessary. Transistors can be made with mobilities superior to that of amorphous silicon, though their commercial viability remains unproven. Careful control of bandgaps, molar masses and solid-state order combined with the development of new acceptor molecules has led to the fabrication of OPV devices with efficiencies close to 20%, which is better than many commercial solar cells. The commercial viability of OPVs remains to be demonstrated with device lifetimes still needing improvement, but these results combined with the low cost of making and processing conjugated polymers suggests such devices could be competitive with current ones with further optimisation.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

Funding for this program is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) Technical Development Office (TDO) program. The objectives of the AGR-2 experiment are to: (a) Irradiate UCO (uranium oxycarbide) and UO2 (uranium dioxide) fuel produced in a large coater. Fuel attributes are based on results obtained from the AGR-1 test and other project activities. (b) Provide irradiated fuel samples for post-irradiation experiment (PIE) and safety testing. (c) Support the development of an understanding of the relationship between fuel fabrication processes, fuel product properties, and irradiation performance. The primary objective of the test was to irradiate both UCO and UO2 TRISO (tri-structural isotropic) fuel produced from prototypic scale equipment to obtain normal operation and accident condition fuel performance data. The UCO compacts were subjected to a range of burnups and temperatures typical of anticipated prismatic reactor service conditions in three capsules. The test train also includes compacts containing UO2 particles produced independently by the United States, South Africa, and France in three separate capsules.

The specific surface area (SSA), crystallite size, and magnetic properties of the synthesized products have been determined. The synthesized ferrites are nanocrystalline single-phase materials with crystallite size of 5-40 nm. The SSA of nanoparticles synthesized in plasma is 28-30 m2/g, the particle size distribution is in the range of 10-100 nm, with some individual particles up to 200 nm. The SSA of the ferrites obtained by the self-combustion and hydrothermal synthesis is 40 ± 3 and 60 ± 5 m2/g, respectively. The SSA of the samples obtained by the spray-drying method is 80-90 m2/g, and the calculated particle size is 13-15 nm. In this process, pellets up to 10 μm are obtained.

The chapter highlights the affinities between the gestures of assimilation and quotation as two forms of repetition and traces the practice of musical quotation in Zeisl’s opera. Looking at the Viennese Jewish composer Gustav Mahler as a model and precursor of Zeisl’s quotational practice, the chapter also demonstrates how repetition as both quotation and assimilation undermines the originary status of the so-called quoted or assimilated original and thereby turns on its head the Wagnerian accusation of Jewish imitation of German culture.

The advanced oxidation process (AOP) that relies on free radicals with very high oxidation potential is a promising technology for tackling these recalcitrant pollutants. A major challenge in the application of the technology is the requirement to generate these free radicals within the treatment system because of their highly unstable nature and extremely short life span. Among the various oxidant radicals, the •OH radical is the one most commonly generated in aqueous systems. Consequently, most AOP systems rely on •OH radicals for oxidation. The classification of AOP systems is based on the method adopted for the generation of free radicals. Some AOP systems use chemical reagents for the generation of free radicals, whereas the others use some form of energy (radiation, light, sound, electricity, etc.).

Our approach is based on assessing whether the occurrence of different types of corrosion can be excluded in the disposal conditions. If this is not the case, we shall recommend the maximum corrosion penetration to be predicted on the basis of experimental results and to assess whether this is below an acceptable level. We have applied this approach to show that the occurrence of stress corrosion cracking in the presence of nitrite ions in the disposal conditions can very likely be excluded.

{"title": "Potential of Fruit and Vegetable Waste: Treatment of Wastewater", "abstract": "The increase in the number of industries worldwide has greatly contaminated the water bodies due to the release of various pollutants in the form of toxic metals, which negatively affect living systems. There are a number of methods and techniques to remove toxic metals from water bodies, for example, precipitation, chemical oxidation and reduction, ultrafiltration, etc. However, these methods are not economically sound. Adsorption is yet another technique, which uses carbon to adsorb different kinds of pollution substances from wastewater. However, its use is also not common because of its high cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need of agro-based inexpensive commodities, which can fruitfully adsorb heavy metals or metal ions. Fruit and vegetable processing industries and households generate waste (e.g., peel and pomace in large quantity). They contain large number of cellulose content and other vital components, such as hemicelluloses, lipids, lignin, simple sugars, proteins, water, starch, and hydrocarbon. As a result, these agrowastes are potentially utilized in the treatment of highly polluted water. Fruit and vegetable wastes are endowed with high adsorption capacities and therefore are eco-friendly alternatives to the costly methods and are generally used methodologies in the wastewater remediation.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

{"title": "Full Thickness Skin Grafts", "abstract": "Skin is the largest organ of the human body and has a number of essential functions. It forms a protective barrier against pathogens and the internal and external environment. It acts as a water resistant barrier so that essential nutrients are not washed out of the body. It provides a dry and semi-permeable barrier to fluid loss. Langerhan cells in the skin are part of the adaptive immune system . The skin plays an important role in sensation and contains a number of nerve endings that respond to heat and cold, vibration, pressure, touch and pain. Thermoregulation is another essential function of the skin. Finally, the skin also plays a vital role in the synthesis of Vitamin D. It is imperative that skin cover is preserved in humans for all the reasons mentioned above. Skin grafts are harvested from a donor site and transferred to a distant recipient site (bed) without carrying its own blood supply. The graft relies on new blood vessels from the recipient site bed to be generated (angiogenesis). Full thickness skin grafts consist of the entire epidermis and dermis. These grafts are a simple and reliable method of achieving closure of skin defects where primary closure or healing by secondary intention is not possible. Full-thickness skin grafts are generally used to resurface smaller defects because they are limited in size. They are invaluable for reconstruction of defects where good cosmetic outcome or a durable skin cover is necessary. Common areas include defects on the face, scalp and hand, often following excision of skin lesions. A suitable well vascularized bed is necessary for full-thickness skin graft take. ‘Take’ is the process which results in the reattachment and revascularization of the skin graft.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 0}

The relationship between the concentrations of the calibration standards and the instrumental response is expressed by a mathematical model, which allows predicting the concentrations of new sample. A distinction should be made between outliers in the calibration set when standards are injected once and outliers in replicate measurements at a given concentration, since the former will have more influence on the calibration model than the latter. Calibration lines are often used in chromatography, where the preference is given to a straight-line Ordinary least-square (OLS) model.

{"title": "Permanent magnets based on hard ferrite ceramics", "abstract": "Permanent magnets are integral components in many of the modern technologies that are critical for the transition to a sustainable society. However, most of the high-performance (BHmax &gt; 100 kJ/m3) permanent magnets that are currently employed contain rare earth elements (REE), which have long been classified as critical materials with a high supply risk and concerns regarding pollution in their mining. Therefore, suitable REE-lean/free magnets must be developed in order to ensure the sustainability of clean energy generation and electric mobility. The REE-free hexagonal ferrites (or hexaferrites) are the most used permanent magnets across all applications, with an 85 wt.% pie of the permanent magnet market. They are the dominant lower-grade option (BHmax &lt; 25 kJ/m3) due to their relatively good hard magnetic properties, high Curie temperature (&gt;700 K), low cost and good chemical stability. In recent years, the hexaferrites have also emerged as candidates for substituting REE-based permanent magnets in applications requiring intermediate magnetic performance (25–100 kJ/m3), due to considerable performance improvements achieved through chemical tuning, nanostructuring and compaction/sintering optimization.

When the Al-Al3Ti alloy is deformed by ECAP under route A, fine Al3Ti platelet particles are observed. These Al3Ti platelet particles are aligned along to deformation axis, and its plane normal is perpendicular to the deformation axis. On the other hand, Al-Al3Ti alloy ECAPed under route Bc forms several groups consisted of fine Al3Ti platelet particles. Moreover, longitudinal size of the Al3Ti particle groups is close to that of initial Al3Ti particles with 4-pass ECAP specimen.

Experimental studies of the structure and chemistry of well-defined single crystal diamond surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum are unfortunately more difficult than comparable studies of many other materials. Polishing of diamond typically leaves surfaces that are predominantly hydrogen- terminated, although oxygen is also present at some level. An alternative surface preparation procedure is to grow a hoinoepitaxial layer by chemical vapor deposited (CVD).

The basic system of equations for water surface waves (3.27) does not include a small parameter explicitly. But, for example, in the situation of long wave in which the wavelength λ is much longer than the water depth h (i.e., h/λ ≪ 1) or in the situation of quasi-monochromatic wavetrain to be dealt with in Chapter 6 in which the width of the spectrum ∆k is much smaller than the carrier wavenumber kc (i.e., ∆ k/kc ≪ 1), small parameters appear when the equations are non-dimensionalized in an appropriate manner. By using the perturbation method that makes use of the smallness of the parameter, it is possible to obtain an approximate solution or to reduce the equation itself to a simpler one. Thus, the perturbation method will play an important role in many parts of this book in the future, so the basic knowledge about it will be summarized in this chapter.

This step is often the first and rate limiting step in redox reactions of environmental contaminants, so there has been a great deal of interest in the corresponding one-electron reduction potentials (E 1). Although E 1 can be obtained by experimental methods, calculation from first-principles chemical structure theory is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative. Sufficient data are now available to perform a critical assessment of these methods—and their results—for two types of contaminant degradation reactions: dehalogenation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds (CACs) and reduction of nitro aromatic compounds (NACs). Early datasets containing E 1's for dehalogenation of CACs by dissociative SET contained a variety of errors and inconsistencies, but the preferred datasets show good agreement between values calculated from thermodynamic data and quantum mechanical models. All of the datasets with E 1's for reduction of NACs by SET are relatively new, were calculated with similar methods, and yet yield a variety of systematic differences. Further analysis of these differences is likely to yield computational methods for E 1's of NAC nitro reduction that are similar in reliability to those for CAC dechlorination. However, comparison of the E 1 data compiled here with those calculated with a more universal predictive model (like SPARC) highlight a number of challenges with implementation of models for predicting properties over a wide range of chemical structures.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}
{"title": "Optical Basicity and Nepheline Crystallization in High Alumina Glasses", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to find compositions that increase waste loading of high-alumina wastes beyond what is currently acceptable while avoiding crystallization of nepheline (NaAlSiO4) on slow cooling. Nepheline crystallization has been shown to have a large impact on the chemical durability of high-level waste glasses. It was hypothesized that there would be some composition regions where high-alumina would not result in nepheline crystal production, compositions not currently allowed by the nepheline discriminator. Optical basicity (OB) and the nepheline discriminator (ND) are two ways of describing a given complex glass composition. This report presents the theoretical and experimental basis for these models. They are being studied together in a quadrant system as metrics to explore nepheline crystallization and chemical durability as a function of waste glass composition. These metrics were calculated for glasses with existing data and also for theoretical glasses to explore nepheline formation in Quadrant IV (passes OB metric but fails ND metric), where glasses are presumed to have good chemical durability. Several of these compositions were chosen, and glasses were made to fill poorly represented regions in Quadrant IV. To evaluate nepheline formation and chemical durability of these glasses, quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the Product Consistency Test were conducted. A large amount of quantitative XRD data is collected here, both from new glasses and from glasses of previous studies that had not previously performed quantitative XRD on the phase assemblage.

The objective of this research is to explore the application of PCA for dimensionality reduction in the context of the Auto MPG dataset. PCA works by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. By selecting a subset of these components, we can retain the most informative aspects of the data while reducing its dimensionality. Through the application of PCA to the Auto MPG dataset, we aim to achieve two primary outcomes. Firstly, we aim to identify the most influential features that contribute significantly to the variation in fuel efficiency across different car models. Secondly, we seek to determine the optimal number of principal components to retain, striking a balance between dimensionality reduction and preserving the information necessary for accurate analysis. By implementing PCA and evaluating its performance on the Auto MPG dataset, we hope to provide insights into the potential benefits of dimensionality reduction techniques for automotive data analysis.

In most such scenario microstructure dependent and corrosioninduced chemistry dependent property changes significantly affect performance of cladding, pellet, and housing. Emphasis of this work was on replace conventional pellet-cladding material models with a new straingradient viscoplasticity model that is informed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) based measurements and by nanomechanical Raman spectroscopy (NMRS) based measurements. The TEM measurements are quantitative in nature and therefore reveal stress-strain relations with simultaneous insights into mechanisms of deformation at nanoscale. The NMRS measurements reveal the similar information at mesoscale along with additional information on relating local microstructural stresses with applied stresses. The resulting information is used to fit constants in the strain gradient viscoplasticity model as well as to validate one. During TEM measurements, a micro-electro-mechanical system based setup was developed with mechanical actuation, sensing, heating, and electrical loading. Contrary to post-mortem analysis or qualitative visualization, this setup combines direct visualization of the mechanisms behind deformation with measurement of stress, strain, thermal and electrical properties. The unique research philosophy of visualizing the microstructure at high resolution while measuring the properties led to fundamental understanding in grain size and temperature effects on measured mechanical properties such as fracture toughness. A key contribution is the role of mechanical loading boundary conditions to deconvolute the insitu TEM based nanoscale and NMRS based mesoscale data to bulk behavior. First the literature based pellet cladding mechanical interaction model based on the work of Retel’s and Williamson’s in literature work to predict tempurature and stress distribution in cladding and pellet at normal operating condition was analyzed. Later the data was fitted to find constants for a viscoplastic strain gradient model. The developed model still needs to be refined and calibrated using various experimental results. That remains the focus of future work. Overall, a major thrust of the work was therefore on active control of the microstructure (grain size, defect density and types) exploiting the multi-physics coupling in materials. In particular, using experiments the synergy of current density, mechanical stress and temperature were studied to annihilate defects and recrystallize grains. The developed model is being examined for implementation in BISON. Multiple invited talks, international journal publications, and conference publications were performed by students supported on this work. Another output is support multiple PhD and masters thesis students who will be an important asset for future basic nuclear research. Future Work Recommendations: A nuclear reactor operates under significant variations of thermal loads due to energy cycling and mechanical loads due to constraint effects. Significant thermal and chemical diffusion takes place at the pallet-cladding level. While the proposed work established new experimental approach and new dataset for Zircaloy-4, the irradiation level was in the range of 1-2 dpa. Samples with higher dpa need to be examined. Therefore, a continual of support of the performed work is essential. Currently, these are the only experiments that can measure the produced data. The work also needs to be extended to different fuel types and cladding types such as SiC and FeCrAl based claddings. A combination of datasets for these materials can then be used to analyze accurately predict behavior of critical pellet cladding systems in accident scenario with high heat flux and high thermal loads. This is a BIG unknown as if now.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}
{"title": "Screening Solution Using the Software Platform UNIFI: An Integrated Workflow by Waters", "abstract": "Multi-analyte screening techniques are critical for monitoring environmental samples worldwide. Accuracy and timely information to confirm and quantify components of interest are vital. The method must meet the appropriate regulatory requirements and ideally be streamlined, rapid, and cost effective. To date, LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS tandem quadrupole systems are the \"gold standard\" for these analyses. However, an increasing number of analytes are constantly being added to methodologies creating very large target screening lists. Therefore, many laboratories are turning to high resolution mass spectrometry screening techniques that, in theory, can monitor an unlimited number of targets as well as providing information on unknown or transformation products of interest. Using a non-targeted, data independent approach to acquisition allows the user to collect a comprehensive dataset that can be used to screen for a large target list of targeted or suspect compounds, as well as unexpected, non-targeted compounds. This chapter will discuss the Waters approach to non-target screening analysis.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

{"title": "AI4ESP: Process Discovery through Assimilation of Complex Geochemical Datasets", "abstract": "assay programs consisted of monitoring hydrogen evolution as a function of temperature. This project also incorporated theoretical methods to help select candidate materials families for testing. The Virtual High Throughput Screening served as a virtual laboratory, calculating structures and their properties. First Principles calculations were applied to various systems to examine hydrogen storage reaction pathways and the associated thermodynamics. The experimental program began with the validation of the MT assay tool with NaAlH4/0.02 mole Ti, the state of the art hydrogen storage system given by decomposition of sodium alanate to sodium hydride, aluminum metal, and hydrogen. Once certified, a combinatorial 21-point study of the NaAlH4 LiAlH4Mg(AlH4)2 phase diagram was investigated with the MT assay. Stability proved to be a problem as many of the materials decomposed during synthesis, altering the expected assay results. This resulted in repeating the entire experiment with a mild milling approach, which only temporarily increased capacity. NaAlH4 was the best performer in both studies and no new mixed alanates were observed, a result consistent with the VHTS. Powder XRD suggested that the reverse reaction, the regeneration of the alanate from alkali hydride, Al and hydrogen, was hampering reversibility. The reverse reaction was then studied for the same phase diagram, starting with LiH, NaH, and MgH2, and Al. The study was extended to phase diagrams including KH and CaH2 as well. The observed hydrogen storage capacity in the Al hexahydrides was less than 4 wt. %, well short of DOE targets. The HT assay came on line and after certification with studies on NaAlH4, was first applied to the LiNH2 - LiBH4 - MgH2 phase diagram. The 60-point study elucidated trends within the system locating an optimum material of 0.6 LiNH2 0.3 MgH2 0.1 LiBH4 that stored about 4 wt. % H2 reversibly and operated below 220 Â°C. Also present was the phase Li4(NH2)3BH4, which had been discovered in the LiNH2 -LiBH4 system. This new ternary formulation performed much better than the well-known 2 LiNH2MgH2 system by 50 Â°C in the HT assay. The Li4(NH2)3BH4 is a low melting ionic liquid under our test conditions and facilitates the phase transformations required in the hydrogen storage reaction, which no longer relies on a higher energy solid state reaction pathway. Further study showed that the 0.6 LiNH2 0.3 MgH2 0.1 LiBH4 formulation was very stable with respect to ammonia and diborane desorption, the observed desorption was from hydrogen. This result could not have been anticipated and was made possible by the efficiency of HT combinatorial methods. Investigation of the analogous LiNH2 LiBH4 CaH2 phase diagram revealed new reversible hydrogen storage materials 0.625 LiBH4 + 0.375 CaH2 and 0.375 LiNH2 + 0.25 LiBH4 + 0.375 CaH2 operating at 1 wt. % reversible hydrogen below 175 Â°C. Powder x-ray diffraction revealed a new structure for the spent materials which had not been previously observed. While the storage capacity was not impressive, an important aspect is that it boron appears to participate in a low temperature reversible reaction. The last major area of study also focused on activating boron-based materials in order to exploit the tremendous gravimetric capacity of LiBH4. A number of LiNH2 LiBH4 transition metal (TM) systems were investigated for the following reasons. No additional leads were discovered in this system. Another major project activity was the assembly of a high throughput synthesis system. The automated synthesizer was set up in a glovebox and was capable of handling liquids and powders and carrying out sealed block syntheses up to 250 Â°C. Unfortunately, the synthesizer could not handle the delivery of the fine powders required fro hydrogen storage applications. Although the powder delivery system was overhauled and redesigned several times, this problem was never remedied.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

Unlocking it could significantly facilitate chemical synthesis and hence, accelerate the discovery of novel molecules and materials. With the current rise of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, access to cheap computing power, and the wide availability of chemical data, it became possible to develop entirely data-driven mathematical models able to predict chemical reactivity. Similar to how a human chemist would learn chemical reactions, those learn by repeatedly looking at examples, the underlying patterns in the data. In this chapter, we compare the state-of-the-art data-driven learning systems for forward chemical reaction prediction, analyzing the reaction representations, the data, and the model architectures. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the different AI model strategies and make comparisons on standard open-source benchmark datasets.

{"title": "Heavy-Tailed Universality Predicts Trends in Test Accuracies for Very Large Pre-Trained Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "Given two or more Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with the same or similar architectures, and trained on the same dataset, but trained with different solvers, parameters, hyper-parameters, regularization, etc., can we predict which DNN will have the best test accuracy, and can we do so without peeking at the test data? In this paper, we show how to use a new Theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) to answer this. HT-SR suggests, among other things, that modern DNNs exhibit what we call Heavy-Tailed Mechanistic Universality (HT-MU), meaning that the correlations in the layer weight matrices can be fit to a power law (PL) with exponents that lie in common Universality classes from Heavy-Tailed Random Matrix Theory (HT-RMT). From this, we develop a Universal capacity control metric that is a weighted average of PL exponents. Rather than considering small toy NNs, we examine over 50 different, large-scale pre-trained DNNs, ranging over 15 different architectures, trained on ImagetNet, each of which has been reported to have different test accuracies. We show that this new capacity metric correlates very well with the reported test accuracies of these DNNs, looking across each architecture (VGG16/…/VGG19, ResNet10/…/ResNet152, etc.). We also show how to approximate the metric by the more familiar Product Norm capacity measure, as the average of the log Frobenius norm of the layer weight matrices. Our approach requires no changes to the underlying DNN or its loss function, it does not require us to train a model (although it could be used to monitor training), and it does not even require access to the ImageNet data.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}
{"title": "Enrichment Meter Dataset from High-Resolution Gamma Spectroscopy Measurements of U3O8 Enrichment Standards and UF6 Cylinder Wall Equivalents", "abstract": "The Enrichment Meter Principle (EMP) is the basis for a commonly used standard test method for the non-destructive assay of 235U enrichment in bulk compounds [1]. The technique involves determining the net count rate in the direct 186 keV peak using medium or high energy gamma-ray spectrometry in a fixed geometry. With suitable correction for wall attenuation, compound type, rate loss (live time), and peaked background (if significant), the atom fraction of 235U may be obtained from the counting rate from a linear relationship through the origin. The widespread use of this method for field verification of enrichment [2,3] together with the fact that the response function rests on fundamental physics considerations (i.e., is not represented by a convenient but arbitrary form) makes it an interesting example of uncertainty quantification, one in which one can expect a valid measurement model can be applied. When applied using NaI(Tl) and region of interest analysis, the technique is susceptible to both interference error and bias [2-4]. When implemented using high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, the spectrum interpretation is considerable simplified and more robust [5]. However, a practical challenge to studying the uncertainty budget of the EMP method (for example, to test linearity, extract wall corrections and so forth using modern methods) is the availability of quality experimental data that can be referenced and shared. To fill this gap, the research team undertook an experimental campaign [6]. A measurement campaign was conducted to produce high-resolution gamma spectroscopy enrichment meter data comparable to UF6 cylinder measurements. The purpose of this report is to provide both an introduction to and quality assurance (QA) of the raw data produced. This report is intended for the analyst or researcher who uses the raw data. Unfortunately, the raw data (i.e., the spectra files) are too voluminous to include in this report but can be requested from Steven Croft of the Safeguards & Security Technology Group (scroft@ornl.gov 865-241-2834). The complete processed data are tabulated in Appendix A. The analysis techniques used to produce the QA data presented in this report [e.g., three regions-ofinterest (ROI) peak extraction and batch analysis processes] are not the most sophisticated techniques available; analysts are encouraged to reanalyze the raw data using more sensitive techniques and to improve upon the results presented here.

The SiC matrix is manufactured using binderjet 3D printing followed by loading the TRISO fuel particles and the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process. Because the fuel matrix is a primary component of the TCR core and its response to mechanical and thermal loads during operation is one of the most influential factors on the integrity of TCR core, testing and evaluation have focused on producing mechanical and thermophysical properties data for the binderjet/CVI SiC. Mechanical and thermophysical properties were measured from various types of specimens printed for two or three orientations, which included equibiaxial flexural failure strength, elastic constants, thermal diffusivity and conductivity, density, and the coefficient of thermal expansion. Flexural failure strength datasets showed similar Weibull distributions regardless of sample variants including different orientations. The mean failure strengths of the 3D-printed SiC variants were in the range of 286–306 MPa, which are 22–27% lower than that of the CVD SiC. Thermophysical test results showed that specific heat and thermal expansion are not sensitive to the build directions of SiC samples, while thermal diffusivity is highly dependent on the build direction and can be correlated to the anisotropic character of the 3D-printed SiC.

{"title": "VARIABILITY OF KD VALUES IN CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS AND SEDIMENTS", "abstract": "Measured distribution coefficients (K{sub d} values) for environmental contaminants provide input data for performance assessments (PA) that evaluate physical and chemical phenomena for release of radionuclides from wasteforms, degradation of engineered components and subsequent transport of radionuclides through environmental media. Research efforts at SRNL to study the effects of formulation and curing variability on the physiochemical properties of the saltstone wasteform produced at the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF) are ongoing and provide information for the PA and Saltstone Operations. Furthermore, the range and distribution of plutonium K{sub d} values in soils is not known. Knowledge of these parameters is needed to provide guidance for stochastic modeling in the PA. Under the current SRS liquid waste processing system, supernate from F & H Tank Farm tanks is processed to remove actinides and fission products, resulting in a low-curie Decontaminated Salt Solution (DSS). At the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF), DSS is mixed with premix, comprised of blast furnace slag (BFS), Class F fly ash (FA), and portland cement (OPC) to form a grout mixture. The fresh grout is subsequently placed in SDF vaults where it cures through hydration reactions to produce saltstone, a hardened monolithic waste form. Variation in saltstone composition and cure conditions of grout can affect the saltstone's physiochemical properties. Variations in properties may originate from variables in DSS, premix, and water to premix ratio, grout mixing, placing, and curing conditions including time and temperature (Harbour et al. 2007; Harbour et al. 2009). There are no previous studies reported in the literature regarding the range and distribution of K{sub d} values in cementitious materials. Presently, the Savannah River Site (SRS) estimate ranges and distributions of K{sub d} values based on measurements of K{sub d} values made in sandy SRS sediments (Kaplan 2010). The actual cementitious material K{sub d} values and solubility values differ from the sandy sediments. The K{sub d} value range and distribution currently used in the PA are estimated to range between 0.25*K{sub d} and 1.75*K{sub d}, where the minimum and maximum values of the ranges reflect the 95% confidence level for the mean K{sub d} value (Kaplan 2010). The objective of the research with cementitious materials was to measure the range and distribution of a monovalent (Cs) and I{sup -} (anion), divalent (Sr), and trivalent (Eu) ions for a variety of laboratory-prepared saltstone surrogate samples to establish a K{sub d} range other than that which is presently used in the PA. It has been observed in laboratory samples that cure temperature profiles can affect properties such as heat of hydration, permeability, porosity, compressive strength, and set time (Harbour et al. 2009). The intent was to identify a range and distribution that could be used by stochastic modelers for the PA. Furthermore, the intent was to replace the arbitrarily selected distributions based on geological sandy sediments and to base it on actual cementitious materials. The scope of this study did not include understanding saltstone sorption mechanisms responsible for increasing or decreasing sorption. Similar to the work with cementitious materials, the purpose of the Pu sediment K{sub d} dataset was not to attempt to understand through statistics how to better understand Pu sorption to sediments or to lower Pu K{sub d} variance. The sediment Pu K{sub d} data is included in this study because it is a key risk driver for the PAs on the SRS, and there is presently no direct studies of Pu variability in SRS soils. Instead the distribution of Pu sediment K{sub d} values was assumed to be similar to other cations, as presented by Kaplan (2010).", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

Optical, or physical sectioning, and subsequent imaging of biological tissue at high resolution, offers the chance to postprocess, segment, and reconstruct micro- and nanoscopical structures, and then reveal spatial arrangements previously inaccessible or hardly imaginable with simple, single section, two-dimensional images. In some cases, three-dimensional models highlighted peculiar morphologies in a way that two-dimensional representations cannot be considered representative of that particular object morphology anymore, like mitochondria for instance. Observations like these are taking scientists toward a more common use of 3D models to formulate functional hypothesis, based on morphology. Because such models are so rich in details, we developed tools allowing for performing qualitative, visual assessments, as well as quantification directly in 3D.

{"title": "BRNet: Branched Residual Network for Fast and Accurate Predictive Modeling of Materials Properties", "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have become increasingly popular in the field of materials science for building property prediction models owing to their ability to efficiently extract and understand data-driven relationships between materials composition, structure, and properties. In general, materials property prediction are regression problems with a vector-based input material representation. While fully connected layers have been widely used in deep neural networks to predict materials properties, simply adding more and more layers to create a deep model often degrades their performance due to the vanishing gradient problem, thereby limiting usage. In this paper, we study and propose architectural principles for building deep regression neural networks comprising fully connected layers with numerical vectors that bypass manual feature engineering. We introduce a novel deep regression neural network with branched residual learning, BRNet, consisting of branching of layers to maximize variation of features learned from the input or previous layer and places skip connections after each layer to minimize the information loss due to vanishing gradient. We perform BRNet model training for inorganic material properties using numerical vectors representing the elemental fractions of the compositions of the respective materials and compare its performance against other traditional ML and DL techniques, including ElemNet and IRNet. Using multiple datasets (such as OQMD, MP, JARVIS) for training and testing, we show that BRNet models are significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art ML methods and DL models for all data sizes by using only raw elemental fractions as input. We also show that BRNet's branched residual learning requires fewer parameters and leads to better convergence during the training phase than other neural networks, thus resulting in faster model training.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

The TCR fuel form consists of an additively-manufactured silicon carbide (SiC) matrix and uranium nitride tristructural isotropic (UN TRISO) fuel particles, which is manufactured through a newly developed processing route combining binderjet 3D printing, TRISO fuel particle loading, and chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Because the fuel matrix is a primary component of the TCR core and its response to mechanical and thermal loads during operation is one of the most influential factors on the integrity of TCR core, testing and evaluation have focused on producing mechanical and thermophysical properties data for the binderjet/CVI SiC. Baseline mechanical and thermophysical properties were measured from the disk specimens printed for different and sizes orientations, which included equibiaxial flexural failure strength, elastic constants, thermal diffusivity and conductivity, density, and the coefficient of thermal expansion. Flexural failure strength datasets showed similar Weibull distributions regardless of sample variants including different orientations. The mean failure strengths of the 3D-printed SiC variants were in the range of 280–310 MPa, which are slightly lower than that of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) SiC. Thermophysical test results showed that specific heat and thermal expansion are not sensitive to the build direction of SiC samples, while thermal conductivity is highly dependent on the build direction and can be correlated to the anisotropic character of the 3D-printed SiC. Neutron irradiation tests were carried out on the 3D-printed 6-mm diameter SiC disk specimens. Irradiation was carried to 2.3 dpa over a temperature range of 360–880°C. No significant degradation in strength was observed in SiC after irradiations in various conditions and with different orientations. Anisotropy that had been observed in the thermal conductivity of 3D-printed SiC prior to irradiation vanished after irradiation as the irradiation defect thermal resistivity accumulated in the material. Electron microscopy of the microstructure after neutron irradiation showed distinct defect morphologies in the heterogenous material, but no evidence for irradiation-induced cracking or degradation in the microstructure was observed.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

HAZ data, which tend to have greater scatter due to microstructural variation in the HAZ, are separated into “high scatter” and “low scatter” categories to assess the effect of scatter on TTS trends. In general, the TTS behavior of the HAZ is comparable to the non-HAZ. However, the forging HAZ TTS diverges from the non-HAZ TTS as a function of copper content. This trend is also observed in the plate HAZ when looking at plate HAZ datasets with copper content and PWHT times less than forging copper content (≤0.16 wt. %) and PWHT time (≤20 h). Additionally, TTS of weld and HAZ materials increases with increased PWHT time. These trends are not well captured by modern embrittlement trend curves.

One such promising material system for future high-temperature structural applications in power plants is Silicon Carbide-Silicon Nitride (SiC-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4}) nanoceramic matrix composites. The described research work focuses on multiscale simulation-based design of these SiC-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} nanoceramic matrix composites. There were two primary objectives of the research: (1) Development of a multiscale simulation tool and corresponding multiscale analyses of the high-temperature creep and fracture resistance properties of the SiC-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} nanocomposites at nano-, meso- and continuum length- and timescales; and (2) Development of a simulation-based robust design optimization methodology for application to the multiscale simulations to predict the range of the most suitable phase morphologies for the desired high-temperature properties of the SiC-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} nanocomposites. The multiscale simulation tool is based on a combination of molecular dynamics (MD), cohesive finite element method (CFEM), and continuum level modeling for characterizing time-dependent material deformation behavior. The material simulation tool is incorporated in a variable fidelity model management based design optimization framework. Material modeling includes development of an experimental verification framework. Using material models based on multiscaling, it was found using molecular simulations that clustering of the SiC particles near Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} grain boundaries leads to significant nanocomposite strengthening and significant rise in fracture resistance. It was found that a control of grain boundary thicknesses by dispersing non-stoichiometric carbide or nitride phases can lead to reduction in strength however significant rise in fracture strength. The temperature dependent strength and microstructural stability was also significantly depended upon the dispersion of new phases at grain boundaries. The material design framework incorporates high temperature creep and mechanical strength data in order to develop a collaborative multiscale framework of morphology optimization. The work also incorporates a computer aided material design dataset development procedure where a systematic dataset on material properties and morphology correlation could be obtained depending upon a material processing scientist's requirements. Two different aspects covered under this requirement are: (1) performing morphology related analyses at the nanoscale and at the microscale to develop a multiscale material design and analyses capability; (2) linking material behavior analyses with the developed design tool to form a set of material design problems that illustrate the range of material design dataset development that could be performed. Overall, a software based methodology to design microstructure of particle based ceramic nanocomposites has been developed. This methodology has been shown to predict changes in phase morphologies required for achieving optimal balance of conflicting properties such as minimal creep strain rate and high fracture strength at high temperatures. The methodology incorporates complex material models including atomistic approaches. The methodology will be useful to design materials for high temperature applications including those of interest to DoE while significantly reducing cost of expensive experiments.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

Hardness testing is an especially useful method because it is nondestructive and simple to implement and gauge the plastic properties of a material. In this study, I proposed a machine, or statistical, learning approach to predict hardness in naturally occurring ceramic materials, which integrates atomic and electronic features from composition directly across a wide variety of mineral compositions and crystal systems. First, atomic and electronic features, such as van der Waals, covalent radii, and the number of valence electrons, were extracted from composition. The results showed that this proposed method is very promising for predicting Mohs hardness with F1-scores >0.85. The dataset in this study included modeling across a larger set of materials and hardness values, which have never been predicted in previous studies. Next, feature importances were used to identify the strongest contributions of these compositional features across multiple regimes of hardness.

Both of these drivers have identified understanding and mitigating fuel cracking as a key performance criterion. Small-scale cantilever beam testing has been identified as a plausible method by which to collect fracture data for UO2 as a function of chemical and structural evolutions introduced either during fabrication or irradiation. While this method has been found to be capable of providing data that are in reasonable agreement with literature for unirradiated UO2, the inherently small sample volumes that can be sampled limit its ability to capture the statistical nature of mechanisms that govern the fracture of brittle ceramics. A biaxial flexure strength test was developed to be used for unirradiated UO2. This method is standard in the community, but no systems presently in use at national laboratories, universities, or private companies are available to be used for nuclear fuel materials. This report describes the operation and benchmarking of this system, which has been validated for a number of common oxides. Future work will extend this system to characterization of both doped UO2 and other relevant microstructural modifications that can also be measured using small-scale cantilever beam testing.

{"title": "Data Analysis for Multi-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography", "abstract": "Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography methods, particularly those involving comprehensive multi-dimensional separation, often produce datasets that are much richer and more complex than those normally obtained by conventional one-dimensional separations. Of course, it is great for the analyst to be able to draw on these richer datasets, but the volume and complexity of the data pose new data analysis challenges that cannot be addressed using tools developed for one-dimensional chromatography alone. In this chapter we first discuss recent advances in the development of methods for treating one-dimensional chromatography data, as these do indeed form the basis of methods for treating two-dimensional data. We then go on to discuss challenges unique to the analysis of data from multi-dimensional chromatography methods, and the methods that have been developed to address these challenges. Finally, we discuss multi-way analysis methods that not only are capable of dealing with multi-dimensional data, but are also well suited to capitalize on the power of these methods for resolving chromatographic signals from background signals, and from each other (i.e., mathematical resolution of overlapping peaks). Future advances in this area will benefit from the use of benchmark datasets that allow comparison of new data analysis methods to established ones, and evaluation of method performance using real data from multiple sources.

{"title": "Ballistic Performance of Bi-layer Graphene: Artificial Neural Network Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations", "abstract": "In the present article, we explored the ballistic behaviour of bilayer graphene (BLG) by performing a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The computationally expensive nature of large scale MD simulations frequently hinders a thorough understanding of material characterization. To mitigate this lacuna we demonstrated the successful integration of MD simulation with the artificial neural network (ANN). In this regard, the considered input parameter [impact velocity (Vi)] is perturbed in the range of 1–7 km/s using the Monte Carlo sampling technique to construct the sample space with 128 instances. The BLG (size 200 Å × 200 Å) is impacted by a spherical diamond projectile (diameter 25 Å) in a series of MD simulations of high-velocity impact with varied impact velocities. As a response, the residual velocity of the projectile (Vr) and specific penetration energy ( $$E_{p}^{*}$$ ) of the BLG are determined for each instance. The deterministic responses revealed that with the increase in the impact velocity the Vr and $$E_{p}^{*}$$ values increases. Besides the numerical responses, the post-impact behaviour of BLG is also classified into four different stages viz. R, PP1, PP2 and CP, based on the extent of damage to the BLG and the post-impact trajectory of the projectile. The dataset generated with the MCS based MD simulation is further used to construct the ANN based regression and classification model. In this manner, the current article proposed a framework to accelerate the nanoscale material characterization by augmenting the ANN with MD simulations.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}
{"title": "RHALE: Robust and Heterogeneity-Aware Accumulated Local Effects", "abstract": "Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) is a widely-used explainability method for isolating the average effect of a feature on the output, because it handles cases with correlated features well. However, it has two limitations. First, it does not quantify the deviation of instance-level (local) effects from the average (global) effect, known as heterogeneity. Second, for estimating the average effect, it partitions the feature domain into user-defined, fixed-sized bins, where different bin sizes may lead to inconsistent ALE estimations. To address these limitations, we propose Robust and Heterogeneity-aware ALE (RHALE). RHALE quantifies the heterogeneity by considering the standard deviation of the local effects and automatically determines an optimal variable-size bin-splitting. In this paper, we prove that to achieve an unbiased approximation of the standard deviation of local effects within each bin, bin splitting must follow a set of sufficient conditions. Based on these conditions, we propose an algorithm that automatically determines the optimal partitioning, balancing the estimation bias and variance. Through evaluations on synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of RHALE compared to other methods, including the advantages of automatic bin splitting, especially in cases with correlated features.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

Identifying plants with healing properties requires extensive knowledge and experience, and relies heavily on human perception, which can lead to errors. Leveraging Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks and transfer learning to overcome these limitations, we have worked to develop an integrated system for the identification of medicinal plants native to India. Our system identifies 98 different classes using a dataset of 15,022 real-world images of weeds, herbs, shrubs, and trees with 92% accuracy and gives the therapeutic uses of each identified plant. This approach will empower people with the knowledge necessary to preserve and enhance traditional medicinal practices, bridging the gap between age-old practice and integrative modern medicine. This system uses Xception as the base model with a custom classification layer which can be modified to ensure scalability, by increasing the dataset to include medicinal plant species found locally and their medicinal benefits.

Nonetheless, they can be susceptible to overfitting, especially when the tree grows excessively deep. To address this concern, ensemble methods such as random forests have gained popularity. These methods combine multiple decision trees to enhance classification performance.

The simultaneous Rietveld refinement of five histograms from the five HIPPO detector rings provided fundamental datasets for the lattice parameters, anisotropic atomic displacement parameters, and atomic positions as a function of temperature.

These include thermophysical properties as well as burst characteristics, oxidation kinetics, possible eutectic interactions, and failure temperatures. These properties can vary among different FeCrAl alloys. Oak Ridge National Laboratory has pursued refined values for the oxidation kinetics of the B136Y FeCrAl alloy (Fe-13Cr-6Al wt %). This investigation included oxidation tests with varying heating rates and end-point temperatures in a steam environment. The rate constant for the low-temperature oxidation kinetics was found to be higher than that for the commercial APMT FeCrAl alloy (Fe-21Cr-5Al-3Mo wt %). Compared with APMT, a 5 times higher rate constant best predicted the entire dataset (root mean square deviation). Based on tests following heating rates comparable with those the cladding would experience during a station blackout, the transition to higher oxidation kinetics occurs at approximately 1,500°C. A parametric study varying the low-temperature FeCrAl oxidation kinetics was conducted for a BWR plant using FeCrAl fuel cladding and channel boxes using the MELCOR code. A range of station blackout severe accident scenarios were simulated for a BWR/4 reactor with Mark I containment. Increasing the FeCrAl low-temperature oxidation rate constant (3 times and 10 times that of the rate constant for APMT) had a negligible impact on the early stages of the accident and minor impacts on the accident progression after the first relocation of the fuel. At temperatures below 1,500°C, increasing the rate constant for APMT by a factor of 10 still resulted in only minor FeCrAl oxidation. In general, the gains afforded by the FeCrAl enhanced ATF concept with respect to accident sequence timing and combustible gas generation are consistent with previous efforts. Compared with the traditional Zircaloy-based cladding and channel box system, the FeCrAl concept could provide a few extra hours of time for operators to take mitigating actions and/or for evacuations to take place. A coolable core geometry is retained longer, enhancing the ability to stabilize an accident. For example, a station blackout was simulated in which cooling water injection was lost 36 hours after shutdown.

{"title": "Standardization and Normalization of Data from Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry", "abstract": "Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is a useful technique for the precise determination of major, minor and trace element distributions or isotope ratios in solid samples and biological tissue sections. However, measured ion intensities of selected mass-to-charge ratios, may vary considerably from run to run and might also underlie non-linear drift within a run. Therefore, beside the calibration of the measurement, normalization of ion intensities to a reference such as an internal standard is necessary. Other strategies use an endogenous reference element of which a homogenous distribution in the sample is assumed, or derive a more complex reference parameter from a given dataset. Generally, normalization methods depend on the experimental setup and sample material and are usually based on one or few isotopes or the total ion current. This chapter reports different normalization methods that either used a separate reference value for each data point – constituting a pixel in the isotope image – or used a constant normalization factor per measurement run. In conclusion, normalization is essential to minimize deviations of element concentrations due to measurement-related fluctuations. Normalization and definition of an area of interest are powerful tools to obtain high-contrast isotope images with absolute element concentrations.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

{"title": "Post-Irradiation Fracture Toughness Characterization of Generation II FeCrAl Alloys", "abstract": "Currently, the handbook on FeCrAl material properties contains only limited data regarding the fracture toughness properties of any FeCrAl alloy, let alone alloys currently under investigation within the Advanced Fuels Campaign (AFC) such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) derived FeCrAl alloys. Unirradiated datasets developed both by ORNL and previously within literature using Charpy V-notch specimens to determine the ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT) showed key findings including (i) increasing Al and/or Cr content can raise the DBTT of FeCrAl alloys, (ii) DBTT values can typically reside at or above room temperature for FeCrAl alloys, and (iii) grain size and residual strain can have an effect on the fracture properties. These results suggest that the fracture toughness of FeCrAl alloys may be a factor in its deployment for nuclear power applications, but no studies have been completed prior regarding the DBTT or fracture toughness of FeCrAl alloys after neutron irradiation, especially for the leaner Cr content alloys currently under investigation as candidate alloys for light water reactor (LWR) cladding. Taken in isolation, embrittlement of a cladding alloy during service has no bearing on possible licensure. Hydriding of zirconium cladding alloys is well understood to result in significant embrittlement. Furthermore, mechanical failure of irradiated cladding containing fuel pellets occurs at far higher stresses than defueled cladding samples because the presence of the fuel toughens the fuel rod. Despite this absence of direct relevance to licensure, radiation embrittlement is a fundamental structure-property evolution that should be understood to guide further development of FeCrAl alloys. Licensure of FeCrAl incorporates far more complex system behaviors that will not be possible until larger quantities of fueled irradiated rodlets are available.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

At high temperatures, FeCrAl alloys have slower oxidation kinetics and higher strength compared with zirconium-based alloys. FeCrAl could be used for fuel cladding and spacer or mixing vane grids in light water reactors and/or as channel box material in boiling water reactors (BWRs). There is a need to assess the potential gains afforded by the FeCrAl accident-tolerant-fuel (ATF) concept over the existing zirconium-based materials employed today.

Counterfeit documents are increasingly being produced using various means, necessitating expertise in questioned documents and analytical research methods.

However, interpreting the spectral information obtained from modern spectrophotometers, which includes data on inks, toners, papers, and other materials in the questioned document, presents a significant challenge due to the sheer volume of data and chemical information involved. This poses a constant need for experts to analyse large datasets and extract meaningful information that can answer court queries and aid in accurate interpretation of outcomes.

Flexural failure strength datasets showed similar Weibull distributions regardless of sample variants including different orientations. The mean failure strengths of the 3D-printed SiC variants were in the range of 280–310 MPa, which are slightly lower than that of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) SiC. Thermophysical test results showed that specific heat and thermal expansion are not sensitive to the build direction of SiC samples, while thermal conductivity is highly dependent on the build direction and can be correlated to the anisotropic character of the 3D-printed SiC. Neutron irradiation tests were carried out on the 3D-printed 6-mm diameter SiC disk specimens. Irradiation was carried to 2.3 dpa over a temperature range of 360–880°C. No significant degradation in strength was observed in SiC after irradiations in various conditions and with different orientations. Anisotropy that had been observed in the thermal conductivity of 3D-printed SiC prior to irradiation vanished after irradiation as the irradiation defect thermal resistivity accumulated in the material.

It was assumed that additional research and development work in glass formulation and melter testing would be performed to improve the understanding of component effects on the processability and product quality of these HLW glasses. Recommendations were made to better estimate the potential component concentration limits that could be applied today while technology development is underway to best estimate the volume of HLW glass that will eventually be produced at Hanford. The limits for concentrations of P2O5, Bi2O3, and SO3 were evaluated along with the constraint used to avoid nepheline formation in glass. Recommended concentration limits were made based on the current HLW glass property models being used by HTWOS (Vienna et al. 2009). These revised limits are: 1) The current ND should be augmented by the OB limit of OB ≤ 0.575 so that either the normalized silica (NSi) is less that the 62% limit or the OB is below the 0.575 limit. 2) The mass fraction of P2O5 limit should be revised to allow for up to 4.5 wt%, depending on CaO concentrations. 3) A Bi2O3 concentration limit of 7 wt% should be used. 4) The salt accumulation limit of 0.5 wt% SO3 may be increased to 0.6 wt%. Again, these revised limits do not obviate the need for further testing, but make it possible to more accurately predict the impact of that testing on ultimate HLW glass volumes.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}
{"title": "Analytical Techniques for Heavy Metal Analysis", "abstract": "The enduring presence of heavy metals (HMs), along with their adverse impact on both the environment and human health, has garnered significant scrutiny in analytical chemistry. This chapter elucidates a wide range of analytical techniques employed to detect and measure HMs in various matrices. The analysis of HMs is imperative due to their non-biodegradable nature and propensity to accumulate within ecosystems, resulting in ecological repercussions and potential risks to human well-being through the food chain. It encompasses both conventional and modern HM detection techniques. Classical methodologies, such as Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) with Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (AFS) are discussed. These methods excel in quantifying low levels of HMs in complex matrices due to their exceptional sensitivity and precision. Advances in analytical technology have yielded innovative approaches for HM analysis. X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) offer rapid, non-destructive elemental analysis, catering to in-situ and real-time monitoring requirements. Moreover, Chromatographic methods, e.g., Gas Chromatography (GC) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with diverse detection strategies (MIP-AES), provide separation and quantification capabilities, particularly for intricate metal species within matrices. Electrochemical techniques, including voltammetry and potentiometry, are employed for their selectivity and low detection limits. Recent developments in emerging technologies showcase the potential to enhance sensitivity, selectivity, and portability in HM analysis. Nanomaterial-based sensors and microfluidic devices are illustrative examples of these innovations.

In line with this, biodigesters minimize food waste by using microbes to convert it into fertilizer and biogas. However, foreign objects thrown in, like bones, oily food, etc., which cannot be decomposed by microbes within, limit their effectiveness. Thus, separating these objects from digestible waste through image segmentation is paramount to the success of biodigesters. Existing image segmentation methods include traditional ones like GrabCut, which use colour and contrast to construct an energy function for minimization, while neural network-based methods like YOLO and R-CNN use backpropagation to optimize parameters. In this paper, we attempt to segment bones from food waste images. We prepared a dataset of 108 images of bones to train a CNN to recognize bones and tested it on labelling bounding boxes around bones in 20 food waste images (half of which actually contained bones). Out of the 10 images of food waste containing bones, we tested GrabCut's ability to segment the bones from the remaining bounding boxes. Unfortunately, images of food waste containing bones were highly limited on the Internet. We found the CNN performed poorly. Our small dataset possibly led to the CNN not learning to filter background noise. For GrabCut, we obtained best performance with maximum foreground-background contrast, but not otherwise. We propose modifying the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to account for more background variation and less foreground variation.

The most difficult task for global researchers today is to develop anticancer leads with minimal side effects. Heterocyclic chemistry is an important and unique class of medicinal chemistry as a large number of drugs being used in chemotherapy have a heterocyclic ring as their basic structure, in spite of various side effects. Because of the presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, heterocyclic compounds can be used as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. As a result, they can more effectively bind to pharmacological targets and receptors via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in pharmacological effects. They can also change the liposolubility and thus the aqueous solubility of drug molecules, resulting in remarkable pharmacotherapeutic properties. Medicinal chemists are concentrating on anticancer agents based on heterocyclic compounds. The goal of this chapter is to attempt to compile a dataset of advances in various nitrogen and oxygen-containing heterocyclic rings with anticancer activities from 2017 to 2020.

First, a classification model was created to discriminate between injected and non-injected tuna samples. Then, a second classification model was developed to discriminate between non-injected and each water and additives treatment used. The results were promising, showing both models good results in the validation dataset. The first model, with 8 latent variables (LV), had an error-rate of 0.08 and an accuracy value of 0.93.

This effort represents the first systematic study to determine what F concentration limits should be used for the design of alkali-borosilicate-based Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) HLW glasses, and to document the technical basis for that limit. If alkali borosilicate glass made from Hanford HLW can accommodate a large amount of F, the large capital costs for complex sludge washing facilities may be avoided, as would much of the operational costs and negative schedule impacts associated with handling the large volumes of water required to dissolve these salts. In order to determine a limit for F in likely HLW glass compositions, an evaluation was conducted on glasses with F ≤ 0.90 mass% from previous nuclear waste glass studies. The collected dataset contains 239 glasses (232 HLW glasses and 7 LAW glasses) including 109 glasses with 0.9 ≤ F mass% ≤ 2.5, 116 with 2.5 < F mass% ≤ 8.0, and 14 with F mass% ≥ 8 (max. F mass% = 17.42). The collected composition and property data were analyzed to determine the basis for the F tolerance, i.e. the maximum F concentration that can be processed without potential issues. Fluorine volatility, product consistency test (PCT) response, liquidus temperature (TL), glass melt viscosity, and crystallinity have been investigated. No limits for F concentration can be made based on F volatility, TL, or glass melt viscosity, because the data show that high F in glasses do not indicate, with high probability, being restricted by those property constrains. However, crystallinity and PCT response were used to estimate the F tolerance. The results show that glasses with high F (≥ 0.90 mass%) are more likely to form large fractions of F-containing crystal phases which may increase PCT responses, i.e. decrease the glass durability. Based on the results of crystallinity and PCT data, the F tolerance of 4.5 mass% is estimated. There is no evidence of other glass components, such as calcium oxides and alkali metal oxides have combined impacts with F on the glass properties. Overall, the available high-F glass data is limited, especially in the designed HLW glass composition regions. Future work on formulation and testing of HLW glasses with F ≥ 0.9 mass% will close the data gaps and expand operational flexibility with respect to the fluoride tolerances. Volatility of F from melters and corrosion of materials in contact with glass melts are important for processing of high-F wastes; yet no test data are currently available.

To begin, we explore the history of materials science and catalysts science, emphasizing the traditional approach of designing materials and catalysts based on researchers' knowledge and a trial-and-error process. For a long time, the development of new materials and catalysts relied heavily on empirical observations, experimental iterations, and theoretical insights. This approach required significant time, resources, and expertise, often leading to slow progress and limited success in achieving desired material properties and catalyst performances. However, with the rapid advancements in data acquisition, storage, and analysis technologies, a new paradigm has emerged, known as materials informatics and catalysts informatics. These disciplines aim to leverage data science methodologies, such as statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, to extract knowledge and insights from large datasets generated by experimental, theoretical, and computational studies. By employing materials informatics and catalysts informatics, researchers can overcome the limitations of the traditional approach. These emerging fields enable the systematic exploration and design of materials and catalysts by leveraging data-driven approaches. Rather than relying solely on researchers' intuition and experience, materials informatics and catalysts informatics utilize data-driven models and algorithms to accelerate the discovery and design of materials and catalysts with desired properties and performances. The birth of materials informatics and catalysts informatics signifies a paradigm shift in materials and catalysts science. They allow researchers to harness the power of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and structure-property relationships that were previously difficult to discern.

The HR-EBSD approach allowed for investigating and quantifying internal stresses and dislocation structures in nondeformed and deformed steels, materials used in light water reactor internal components. The literature regarding the HR-EBSD analysis of metals and alloys is very limited, and practically no publications on the HR-EBSD analysis coupled with in situ tests are available. Experimental work, performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Low Activation Materials Development and Analysis facility, is detailed in this report. Section 1 briefly describes strain and stress localization processes and underlines their importance and role in irradiated materials, materials used in nuclear power plants. The section demonstrates that very limited quantitative data exist regarding localized stresses and strains in the irradiated materials at the meso-level (i.e., inside the grain, for a group of interacting grains, or for channel–grain boundary [GB] interaction) whereas local stresses at GBs are key contributors to the stress corrosion crack initiation.Section 2 documents the key methods used to conduct the experimental work: the SEM/EBSD system, miniature tensile frame, and irradiated material. Irradiated specimen manufacturing is described, as this option may be of special interest for other projects. Section 3 provides details of the HR-EBSD in situ tests (e.g., tensile curves, geometry, dimensions of regions of interest, load, and deformation steps). Section 4 discusses the results related to the evolution of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) and their density, spatial, and statistical distributions.Section 5 focuses on the HR-EBSD analysis with respect to a channel–GB interaction. Two aspects are discussed in detail: mapping and analyzing the GND fields before and after loading, and the possibility of investigating local stresses and elastic strains at the channel–GB interaction. The present work results are beneficial for understanding strain and stress localization processes leading to crack initiation, for analyzing the material after long-term in-service life, and for developing predictive models. Section 6 summarizes the work performed and discusses future activities within this research direction.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

{"title": "Identification of Protease Substrates in Complex Proteomes by iTRAQ-TAILS on a Thermo Q Exactive Instrument", "abstract": "The human genome encodes more than 560 proteases, but only for few of them the substrate proteins are known. This is mainly due to high numbers of potential substrate targets for any given protease that cannot be comprehensively explored by conventional candidate approaches. In this chapter, we describe a proteomics protocol for the reliable identification of protease substrates on a proteome-wide scale. Notably, this method termed iTRAQ-Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) does not require any prior knowledge on candidate proteins. Instead, it is used as an unbiased discovery approach to identify protease-substrate relations in complex biological samples. In addition, iTRAQ-TAILS not only identifies substrate proteins but also maps cleavage sites with amino acid precision. Knowing the cleavage site enables the researcher to perform specific downstream analyses and eliminates the need for laborious follow-up experiments like Edman sequencing. iTRAQ-TAILS acquires this rich information by exploiting the power of latest generation mass spectrometers as the Thermo Q Exactive instrument. Through quantitative assessment of protein N-termini in protease-exposed and control samples and a robust data analysis pipeline, iTRAQ-TAILS can systematically screen proteome-wide substrate spaces for proteolytic events exerted by proteases of interest.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

However, in petroleum reservoir the proportions of gas, liquid, and solid depend on subsurface conditions and on the phase diagram (envelop) of the petroleum mixture. To obtain compositions of a reservoir fluid, a reservoir sample is flashed into gas and liquid phases at ambient conditions. The volume of the flashed gas, and the mass, molar mass and density of the flashed liquid are measured.

Integrating information on the inherent variability in nuclear-grade graphite with more complete datasets is one of the goals of the VHTR Graphite Materials program. Between “sister” specimens, or specimens with the same geometry machined from the same sub-block of graphite from which the irradiated AGC specimens were extracted, and the Baseline datasets, a comprehensive body of data will exist that can provide both a direct and indirect indication of the full irradiated property distributions that can be expected of irradiated nuclear-grade graphite while in service in a VHTR system.

{"title": "Labeling Methods in Mass Spectrometry Based Quantitative Proteomics", "abstract": "IntroductionProteomics is loosely defined as the description of sets of proteins from any biological source, which have in most cases been identified by using mass spectrometry.However, only the mere identity of proteins present in a certain sample does not give any information about the dynamics of the proteome, involving relevant cellular events such as protein synthesis and degradation, or the formation of protein assemblies.In order to retrieve information on proteome dynamics, relative protein abundances between different protein samples should be assessed.Comparative or differential proteomics aims to identify and q u a n t i f y p r o t e i n s i n d i f f e r e n t s a m p l e s , t o s t u d y e.g.differences between healthy and diseased states, mutant and wildtype cell lines, undifferentiated and differentiated cells, etc.Since mass spectrometry is in itself only a qualitative technique, various methods to obtain quantitative information of the proteome have been developed over the past decade and will be described in this Chapter.We will focus on post-digestion labeling methods in the field of functional proteomics.Functional proteomics focuses on characterizing the composition of protein complexes, and generally involves the affinity purification of a protein of interest followed by the identification of co-purifying proteins by mass spectrometry (AP-MS).Generally, proteins in a negative control sample and those identified in the sample containing the protein of interest and its interacting partners are directly compared to determine which of the proteins interact in a specific manner.However, the mere presence or absence of a certain protein in protein data sets as a measure for either overlap or specificity is generally not sufficient, as this gives no information about the relative abundances of the present proteins.A generally recognized problem is the presence of contaminating proteins that are identified in the mass spectrometric screen, but do not really make part of the protein complex.Often, these background proteins are highly abundant proteins that stick to the complex or to beads to which the antibody is conjugated in a non-specific manner.A more accurate and correct approach would therefore involve a strategy in which protein abundance differences between sample and control can be assessed in a quantitative manner and which helps in discriminating bona fide interaction partners from such background proteins.Ideally, a differential mass spectrometric method would allow for an unbiased, sensitive, and highthroughput screening for protein-protein interaction networks. www.intechopen.comIntegrative Proteomics 112 1.1 SDS-PAGE based methods for protein quantitation Two-dimensional sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-SDS-PAGE) has traditionally been a popular method for differential-display proteomics on a global scale, although recently the popularity and applicability of stable isotope LC-MS based methods has exceeded those presented by gel based methods.2D-SDS-PAGE based methods enable the separation of complex protein mixtures on a single gel.Proteins are separated in two dimensions: in the first dimension, they are fractionated according to their isoelectric point using a pH gradient gel, which is subsequently placed on a polyacrylamide gel slab for further separation based on their molecular weight using SDS-PAGE.Proteins are then visualized by staining the gel with a dye such as Coomassie, silver or Sypro Ruby.In principle, for comparative issues, samples are loaded on separate gels and protein spot patterns are compared visually.Proteins that differ in abundance can then be punched out of the gel, digested with a suitable protease and analyzed by mass spectrometry.In a variation of this technique, difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE), proteins from two samples are first labeled with different fluorescent dyes and then mixed, making it possible to compare two different samples on a single gel.Two fluorescence images are recorded and overlayed, and differentially expressed proteins appear in only one of the images (Unlu et al., 1997).Limitations of this method include the manual selection of proteins to be analyzed, making it a time-consuming technique, as well as the limited sensitivity, as a consequence of which that proteins with a low concentration may be failed to be selected.Nowadays, in many laboratories there is a tendency to replace 2D-SDS-PAGE based methods by more powerful, LC-MS based methods for relative protein quantitation. Protein and peptide quantitation using LC-MS based methodsRather than by comparing protein spot intensities on a gel, quantification of proteins in LC/MS based methods is based on the peak height or area of the proteolytic peptide peaks in the mass spectrum and/or chromatogram.As mentioned before, mass spectrometry is not an inherently quantitative analytical technique, meaning that the peak height or area in a mass spectrum in itself does not accurately reflect the abundance of a peptide in the sample.The main reasons for this are the differences in ionization efficiency and detectability of peptides because of their different physicochemical characteristics, as well as the limited reproducibility of an LC-MS experiment.Altogether, this makes it difficult to compare peptide peak intensities between different mass spec runs.In principle however, peak intensity differences of the same analyte within one LC-MS run do accurately reflect the abundance difference.One way to distinguish the same analyte from different sample sources within one LC-MS experiment is by using stable heavy isotope labeling.When different stable isotope labels are used for proteins or peptides which are derived from different samples, the same analyte can in principle be quantified in one experiment.Such heavy stable isotope labels should in principle not affect the biophysical and chemical properties of peptides and proteins, but solely the mass, designating one of the samples as 'light' and the other sample 'heavy' according to the mass introduced by the label.The heavy and light peptides co-elute from the LC column at the same retention time and the heavy stable isotope leads to a mass shift in the mass spectrum, resulting in the observation of peak pairs.The peak heights or areas of such pairs can be compared and give an accurate reflection of the difference in abundance of this peptide between both samples.Heavy stable isotope labels can be introduced at different stages in the sample treatment protocol.Below, we will give an overview of the most widely used labeling techniques.www.intechopen.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

One of the main advantages of PARAFAC is that the solution is unique and there is no rotational freedom as with principal components analysis (PCA). Tucker3 differs from PARAFAC by the presence of an additional tensor green with weights, which is a cube with dimensions equal to decomposition factors. It incorporates additional degrees of freedom, as the final tensor is a weighted sum of score vectors.

In the United States, there have been notifications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of intentions to apply for combined construction and operating licenses for 27 new units over the next decade. The projected growth in nuclear power has focused increasing attention on issues related to the permanent disposal of nuclear waste, the proliferation of nuclear weapons technologies and materials, and the sustainability of a once-through nuclear fuel cycle. In addition, the effective utilization of nuclear power will require continued improvements in nuclear technology, particularly related to safety and efficiency. In all of these areas, the performance of materials and chemical processes under extreme conditions is a limiting factor. The related basic research challenges represent some of the most demanding tests of our fundamental understanding of materials science and chemistry, and they provide significant opportunities for advancing basic science with broad impacts for nuclear reactor materials, fuels, waste forms, and separations techniques. Of particular importance is the role that new nanoscale characterization and computational tools can play in addressing these challenges. These tools, which include DOE synchrotron X-ray sources, neutron sources, nanoscale science research centers, and supercomputers, offer the opportunity to transform and accelerate the fundamental materials and chemical sciences that underpin technology development for advanced nuclear energy systems. The fundamental challenge is to understand and control chemical and physical phenomena in multi-component systems from femto-seconds to millennia, at temperatures to 1000?C, and for radiation doses to hundreds of displacements per atom (dpa). This is a scientific challenge of enormous proportions, with broad implications in the materials science and chemistry of complex systems. New understanding is required for microstructural evolution and phase stability under relevant chemical and physical conditions, chemistry and structural evolution at interfaces, chemical behavior of actinide and fission-product solutions, and nuclear and thermomechanical phenomena in fuels and waste forms.

Solubility: What is all the fuss about?Solubility is a vital parameter in many different scenarios from the direct question \"will compound A dissolve in solvent B?\" to questions such as \"what is the toxicity of a substance?\"(Hutchinson et al., 1979), \"what environmental impacts may a substance have?\"(Doerr-MacEwen et al., 2006) and \"how sensitive are humans to a particular odour?\" (Sell, 2014).As a result, many industries have an interest in determining solubility at an early stage in molecular discovery and development, as well as in later stages of chemical and product formulation.Some may even wish to optimize a molecular design to maximize or minimize solubility depending on the use case (Leach et al., 2006).As a result, the computational prediction of solubility is an attractive idea as no chemicals need to be used, hence many predictions can in principle be run in parallel at minimal cost in terms of human research time, chemical usage and chemical disposal.Computational methods therefore offer the potential to dramatically shorten the time to solution, minimise the environmental impact of molecular discovery and reduce research costs.Nonetheless, the general aim in applying computational methods is not to completely replace laboratory experiments, but rather to guide investigators towards focusing their experimental resources on the most promising areas of research.Solubility is a particularly important property in the pharmaceutical industry, playing a critical role in determining pharmacokinetics -the mechanism by which a substance is transported around the body and excreted; and pharmacodynamics -an active substance's pharmaceutical action in vivo.Pharmacokinetics covers the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) properties, which are all influenced by a substance's bioavailability, i.e. in what concentration and how fast an active compound will be available under physiological conditions at the point of action.For orally administered pharmaceuticals, active substances must pass through gastric fluids, cell membranes, and blood in order to reach their sites of action.This covers a wide variety of environments: hydrophobic, hydrophilic, acidic stomach and slightly acidic to neutral intestinal tract.Many drug molecules are weak acids or bases meaning that ionization can occur in response to such environmental changes, affecting the probability of absorption at different sites within the gastrointestinal tract.As a result of these factors, if a substance has a low solubility, or a significant shift in its solubility profile due to these changes in environment, then the quantity of that substance available within the gastrointestinal tract and bloodstream may consequently be low.This leads to difficulties in formulation as there may be a high variance in the quantity of the active substance available in different patients (Leach et al., 2006).Pharmacodynamics describes the pharmaceutical's therapeutic action.Solubility can affect how easily an active substance can bind to a target, and hence contributes to a substance's pharmacological activity.For the reasons discussed here, solubility has become a major source of attrition in the development of new pharmaceuticals, and the subject of regulatory conditions for low solubility active substances (FDA, 2014).", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

The linear supervised techniques are used when there is a need to obtain a model (an equation) allowing a prediction of a given property from such data. In the simplest way, the modeling problem can be solved by the classical linear regression, called simple linear regression (SLR) or ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Although there are more equations than unknowns and one can yield one compromise solution, this method suffers from common multicollinearity in chemometric datasets. An overfitted model is a model that fits to the calibration data almost without an error, but the modeled dependence is without any sense. A careful validation of the model is absolutely necessary in chemometrics to ensure both lack of overfitting or a lack of fit and to estimate the real predictive ability.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

{"title": "Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry for the Molecular Level Characterization of Natural Organic Matter: Instrument Capabilities, Applications, and Limitations", "abstract": "All living matter in the environment (i.e., animals, plants, microorganisms, etc.) eventually dies and decomposes into what is known as natural organic matter (NOM). NOM is formed from a vast variety of sources that have been chemically or microbially degraded in the environment where they arise, and NOM can be generally described as a complex mixture of organic compounds (Stevenson, 1994). Within this mixture, some compounds retain their individual reactivity and characteristics, while others tend to aggregate together and act as a polymeric unit. Overall, NOM can encompass a variety of natural biomolecules, such as lipids, peptides/protein, amino-sugars, carbohydrates, lignins, tannins, and condensed aromatics. Because NOM is a random assortment of organic constituents, its size, shape, concentration, and other physico-chemical properties vary greatly with location and season. For these reasons, the molecular level characterization of NOM continues to be one of the greatest challenges to modern analytical chemists. NOM is ubiquitously present in all natural waters, soils, sediments, and air, giving NOM a central role in numerous environmental processes. These processes are linked together by the global carbon cycle, which describes the storage and flux of carbon sources and sinks throughout the environment (Thurman, 1985; Eglinton and Repeta, 2003; Perdue and Ritchie, 2003). Special attention is generally paid to land-sea interfaces, atmosphere-sea interfaces, and long-term carbon burial/storage. NOM in soils affects the cation exchange capacity and water retention of soils, which has triggered studies by the agricultural communities. Furthermore, NOM in soils/sediments influences carbon sequestration and burial, and this carbon is altered over long periods of time and can be transformed to petroleum precursors. NOM in soils and rivers can affect the solubility, transport, and eventual fate of anthropogenic pollutants. These hydrophobic organic contaminants can interact and bind with NOM in the environment, making it difficult to trace throughout the river systems that eventually lead to the ocean. The amount of carbon in dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean is approximately the same as that of atmospheric CO2 (Hedges, 1992; Eglinton and Repeta, 2003) and this exchange has been directly linked to climate change (Canadell et al., 2007; Sabine and Feely, 2007).

Availability of Al- or Fe-rich detrital clays likely leads to Mg-rich smectite formation, whereas sepiolite or kerolite is favored in environments with no detrital substrates. Surface waters of the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, provide a good example of alteration of incoming detrital clay minerals into authigenic sediments with strong partitioning of Mg into silicate rather than carbonate phases. Quaternary deposits of Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) and the Olorgesailie Basin (Kenya) provide end members for comparing processes in highly saline and alkaline settings (Olduvai) versus those in diatomaceous fresher water environments (Olorgesailie). Authigenic clays from around the world suggest that illitization and octahedral alterations are decoupled, and therefore indicative of different processes, emphasizing the need to supplement basal layer X-ray diffraction analyses with analyses of hkl reflections and geochemistry of purified phases.

When developing or using health, wellness, or environmental devices, it is important to be aware of the regulations that pertain to that device and ensure that your device is compliant. In fact, because of the potential risks posed by certain medical devices, it is illegal to market or sell a medical device without putting it through the appropriate regulatory processes. Geographical and domain-specific standards provide benchmarks against which the compatibility, interoperability, safety, or quality of a device can be measured. Given this broad scope, it would be impossible to describe, or even list, all the standards that pertain to health, wellness, and environmental sensors within a single chapter.

The Baseline Graphite Characterization Program is endeavoring to minimize the conservative estimates of as-manufactured mechanical and physical properties by providing comprehensive data that captures the level of variation in measured values. In addition to providing a comprehensive comparison between these values in different nuclear grades, the program is also carefully tracking individual specimen source, position, and orientation information in order to provide comparisons and variations between different lots, different billets, and different positions from within a single billet. This report is a preliminary comparison between the two grades of graphite that were initially favored in the two main VHTR designs. NBG-18, a medium-grain pitch coke graphite from SGL formed via vibration molding, was the favored structural material in the pebble-bed configuration, while PCEA, a smaller grain, petroleum coke, extruded graphite from GrafTech was favored for the prismatic configuration. An analysis of the comparison between these two grades will include not only the differences in fundamental and statistically-significant individual strength levels, but also the differences in variability in properties within each of the grades that will ultimately provide the basis for the prediction of in-service performance.

Mechanistic models allow for a better understanding of the material on a micro- and macrostructural level while saving time and money over traditional experiment efforts. Historically, summarized data and correlations are the inputs for empirical material models and model validation. When improving these models for nuclear fuels with experimental results, there is a lack of reliable data readily available. Experiments - RERTR-12 and AFIP6-MkII - were conducted to understand the irradiation behavior of metallic U-10Mo monolithic fuels for use in extreme reactor environments such as research reactors like the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) or the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). Microstructural characteristics of fission gas pores (FGP) in each experiment are collected using an automated image analysis technique developed at the University of Florida and presented here. A series of statistical tests are performed to explore the reliability of the results, as well as understand where the data is lacking and what future data collection is necessary to provide sufficient information to assist modeling efforts. The focus is on the porosity, pore size, and eccentricity of FGPs formed during irradiation in three AFIP6-MkII samples and one RERTR-12 sample. From the analysis, it is clear there are substantial impacts of fission density on the pore structure, but there also exist also underlying connections between each sample and the behavior observed in the pores. Further analyses of the pre- and post-irradiation microstructure are needed to improve the understanding of these connections.

Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 371 comprises two corrective action sites (CASs): • 11-23-05, Pin Stripe Contamination Area • 18-45-01, U-18j-2 Crater (Johnnie Boy) The purpose of this Corrective Action Decision Document/Closure Report is to provide justification and documentation supporting the recommendation that no further corrective action is needed for CAU 371 based on the implementation of corrective actions. The corrective action of closure in place with administrative controls was implemented at both CASs. Corrective action investigation (CAI) activities were performed from January 8, 2009, through February 16, 2010, as set forth in the Corrective Action Investigation Plan for Corrective Action Unit 371: Johnnie Boy Crater and Pin Stripe. The approach for the CAI was divided into two facets: investigation of the primary release of radionuclides and investigation of other releases (migration in washes and chemical releases). The purpose of the CAI was to fulfill data needs as defined during the data quality objective (DQO) process. The CAU 371 dataset of investigation results was evaluated based on the data quality indicator parameters. This evaluation demonstrated the dataset is acceptable for use in fulfilling the DQO data needs. Analytes detected during the CAI were evaluated against final action levels (FALs) established in this document. Radiological doses exceeding the FAL of 25 millirem per year were not found to be present in the surface soil. However, it was assumed that radionuclides are present in subsurface media within the Johnnie Boy crater and the fissure at Pin Stripe. Due to the assumption of radiological dose exceeding the FAL, corrective actions were undertaken that consist of implementing a use restriction and posting warning signs at each site. These use restrictions were recorded in the FFACO database; the U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO) Facility Information Management System; and the NNSA/NSO CAU/CAS files. Therefore, NNSA/NSO provides the following recommendations: • No further corrective actions are necessary for CAU 371. • A Notice of Completion to NNSA/NSO is requested from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for closure of CAU 371. • Corrective Action Unit 371 should be moved from Appendix III to Appendix IV of the FFACO.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

Thermal-fluids characteristics are a vital element of a holistic engineering evaluation of ATF concepts. One vital characteristic related to boiling heat transfer is the critical heat flux (CHF). CHF plays a vital role in determining safety margins during normal operation and also in the progression of potential transient or accident scenarios. This deliverable is a scoping survey of thermal-fluids evaluation and confirmatory experimental validation requirements of accident tolerant cladding concepts with a focus on boiling heat transfer characteristics. The key takeaway messages of this report are: 1. CHF prediction accuracy is important and the correlations may have significant uncertainty. 2. Surface conditions are important factors for CHF, primarily the wettability that is characterized by contact angle. Smaller contact angle indicates greater wettability, which increases the CHF. Surface roughness also impacts wettability. Results in the literature for pool boiling experiments indicate changes in CHF by up to 60% for several ATF cladding candidates. 3. The measured wettability of FeCrAl (i.e., contact angle and roughness) indicates that CHF should be investigated further through pool boiling and flow boiling experiments. 4. Initial measurements of static advancing contact angle and surface roughness indicate that FeCrAl is expected to have a higher CHF than Zircaloy. The measured contact angle of different FeCrAl alloy samples depends on oxide layer thickness and composition. The static advancing contact angle tends to decrease as the oxide layer thickness increases.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

The lack of such methods represents a drawback for meat industry and the research focusing on the possible application of rapid methods is emerging. Many new promising techniques are being tested in meat science such as NIR (near infrared) and FT-IR (Fourier transformed infrared) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, hyperand multispectral imaging techniques, machine/computer vision, biosensors, electronic noses (array of sensors), ultrasound techniques, etc. However, the enormous amount of information provided by these instruments demands an advanced data treatment approach.

The new approach described here uses a physics-based model to predict the long-term creep rupture strength of 316H stainless steel using only short-term test data. The key idea is to use Bayesian inference to find the statistical distribution of the model parameters that best explain the short-term rupture data. Because the model is physics-based these parameters are all microstructural quantities that can be measured through detailed material characterization experiments. The Bayesian prior distributions provide a means for incorporating this characterization data into the final model to improve the accuracy of the long-term model predictions. However, where such data is not available the process still produces an accurate model based on an uniformed prior. Our hypothesis is that this approach more accurately extrapolates the short-term test data when compared to current, empirical methods. The report proves this hypothesis using actual long-term rupture data available for 316H, including tests with rupture times greater than 200,000 hours. The general approach developed here could be applied to other materials and other time-dependent material properties. Applying this new technique to develop long-term qualified material properties, potentially in conjunction with other accelerated qualification approaches like staggered qualification test programs, could greatly reduce the time required to qualify new materials for nuclear service.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

They consist of two parts that can easily rotate relative to each other and their photoexcitation generates an excited singlet state that can deactivate through a) a non-radiative decay process that involves internal conversion to the ground state through rotation or b) a radiative decay process that results in emission of a photon. Any environmental restriction to twisting in the excited state, e.g., high viscosity, can have a dramatic effect on the emission intensity of these fluorophores. The sensitivity of azorubine's photophysical properties to the concentration and temperature-dependent viscosity of model systems (glycerol, glycerol-water, sucrose-water, hydrocolloid-water solutions) was investigated. The molecular mass of the thickening agent affected the photophysical response of the dye, with lesser probe sensitivity found with the larger hydrocolloids; fluorescence studies of pyranine hydration suggest these differences were due to local effects of solute crowding. Advantages and limitations of using food colors as intrinsic luminescent sensors of physical properties related to food quality are discussed.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

The use of appropriate biomarkers for personalized treatment has advantage over conventional therapeutics approach, as it confer maximum effectiveness with minimum side effect. Personalized treatment can be achieved by implementation of omic studies in clinical practices. Application of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic studies deliver a vast amount of data that lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic purposes. Therefore, further exploration in omic study could lead to the implementation of personalized medicine as a standard therapeutic scheme in the clinic. Proteomics is a global study of entire proteins of cell, tissue and organism in a particular condition and time point (Graves & Haystead, 2002). Proteomics is a very comprehensive discipline that includes the study of expression, function, localization, structure, modification, and protein-protein interaction (Graves & Haystead, 2002; Lim & ElenitobaJohnson, 2004). A proteomics experiment generates vast amount of data that require further analysis, and systems biology is the main approach. Systems biology is an integrative science that studies the complex behavior of biological entities at the systems level (Kitano, 2002a, 2002b). Integrating the proteomics data into systems biology language is an important approach in understanding the behavior of the complex organisms at various levels (Souchelnytskyi, 2005). In recent years, our knowledge of proteomics and system biology is growing rapidly and create an excitement in scientific community because of its potential in novel biomarker and drug discovery (Duncan & Hunsucker, 2005). Proteomics studies are highly dependent on the technology for protein separation and identification, and bioinformatics for data analysis.

In drug discovery, for instance, it is important to estimate the treatment effect of a drug on various tissue-specific diseases, as it is expressed over the available genes. Thus, we essentially predict the expression value measurements for several (drug, gene, tissue) triads. To tackle Polyadic Prediction problems, we propose a general framework, called Polyadic Regression, predicting measurements associated with multiple objects.

Because of their unique properties, aerogels have been extensively studied, not only for use as transparent thermal insulators but also as inter-metal dielectric materials, optical and acoustic applications, and the space industry (Muller et.al, 1999; Hrubesh et.al, 2001;Kim & Hyun,2003;Lu et.al,1991). NASA has applied aerogel on the Mars Pathfinder Sojourner rover and Mars Exploration rovers for insulation purposes. Additional applications of aerogels are found in battery electrodes, catalysts and electronic devices (Fricke et.al, 1992; Fricke & Tillotson, 1997; Kuhn et.al, 1995; Chadwick et.al, 2001). Currently SiO2, Al2O3 and C aerogels are reported and available elsewhere. During the production of aerogel a wet gel is formed which dried becomes filled with air. An aerogel is made up of microscopic beads or strand chains connected to form a continuous network, it is considered a solid. The fact that typical aerogels have more than 90% porosity gives them unusual characteristics (Yoda et.al, 1998; Klementiev, 2001). Their structure is composed of a 3D connected network of channels made of thin ligaments. The thickness of ligaments determines the final density and porosity of the aerogel (Reim et al, 2004; Kwon & Choi, 2000). As for thermal insulation application, generally monolithic SiO2 aerogels provide a whole low thermal conductivity due to its extremely high porosity. The thermal conductivity of aerogels is about 100 times smaller than that of full density silica glass, although Kistler made initial thermal conductivity measurements, a detailed understanding of thermal transport in aerogel resulted from investigations carried out (Fricke & Tillotson, 1997). Thermal transport in aerogel occurs via gaseous conductivity, solid conductivity and infrared radiative transfer. Usually at room temperature, aerogels have a low thermal conductivity due to its special gas conduction and solid conduction. However, at higher temperatures, radiative absorption/emission becomes the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Monolithic aerogel behaves poor thermal insulation because it is highly transparent in the 3– 8μm wavelength region. To improve its thermal insulation capacity, approaches such as doping aerogel with carbon have been applied to minimize infrared radiation heat transfer.

Pre-storage drying-transfer operations and early stage storage subject cladding to higher temperatures and much higher pressure-induced tensile hoop stresses relative to in-reactor operation and pool storage. Under these conditions, radial hydrides may precipitate during slow cooling and provide an additional embrittlement mechanism as the cladding temperature decreases below the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT). On the basis of previous test results, susceptibility to radial-hydride precipitation depends on cladding material, microstructure, and pre-drying distribution of hydrides across the cladding wall, as well as peak hoop stresses and temperatures during drying operations and storage.

The FEAST-Metal code calculations for this work are being conducted at LANL in support of on-going activities related to sensitivity analysis of fuel performance codes. The objective is to identify important macroscopic parameters of interest to modeling and simulation of metallic fuel performance. This report summarizes our preliminary results for the sensitivity analysis using 6 calibration datasets for metallic fuel developed at ANL for EBR-II experiments. Sensitivity ranking methodology was deployed to narrow down the selected parameters for the current study. There are approximately 84 calibration parameters in the FEAST-Metal code, of which 32 were ultimately used in Phase II of this study. Preliminary results of this sensitivity analysis led to the following ranking of FEAST models for future calibration and improvements: fuel conductivity, fission gas transport/release, fuel creep, and precipitation kinetics. More validation data is needed to validate calibrated parameter distributions for future uncertainty quantification studies with FEAST-Metal. Results of this study also served to point out some code deficiencies and possible errors, and these are being investigated in order to determine root causes and to improve upon the existing code models.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

The tensile data compilation was published separately (LANL report LA-14493, December 2016). Recognizing the chemical banding of industrially produced U-6Nb, models were developed for the mid-range (6 wt.%) and extrema (4 and 8 wt.%) compositions. Lifetime estimates were calculated for all three alloy classes (4, 6, 8 wt.% nominal) and two measures of total tensile elongation (TE) to failure, namely TE-ext. — extensometer method, and TE-NCD — normalized crosshead displacement method. The conservative assumption was made that whichever composition (4, 6, or 8 wt.% Nb) and property (TE-ext or TE-NCD) was the first to cross the ductility failure threshold would limit the lifetime of the entire component. Tensile strength properties did not figure into the lifetime predictions, but could be useful as agesensitive diagnostics and were also modeled. Of these, only first yield strength is expected to show a change at 40°C aging vs. time = 0 over the ~100-year timespan of engineering interest. Second yield strength evolves more slowly, and ultimate tensile strength slower still. Among all the models, the apparent activation energies for aging were mostly in the narrow 29– 37 kcal/mol range, which is close to that for diffusion of Nb in gamma-uranium. This agreement may be coincidental. The data from recent long-term aging studies substantially improved the model fit quality and robustness of the lifetimes.

Lifetime estimates for generic U-6Nb components were thus updated; the reported value being 800 years. This update represents a small change in lifetime vs. that of the 2012 assessment (540 years). This lifetime estimate emerged from consideration of several model fits specific to the aging datasets and properties chosen. Aging was quantified using quasi-static tensile properties measured on specimens artificially aged for up to 10 years.

There are various quantitative descriptors for characterizing microstructural features, such as grain size, shape, number of neighbors, or misorientation. There are many distances that can be used to determine the similarity between distributions. When one is interested in comparing several distributions, distance measures that determine the similarity between distributions are quite effective in determining which distributions, or datasets, are most alike with regard to the descriptor used to generate the distributions.

{"title": "Quantitative Proteomics Using iTRAQ Labeling and Mass Spectrometry", "abstract": "Proteomics research involves the identification and characterisation of proteins in order to elucidate their function and interactions with other proteins. Since the composition of protein mixtures can vary between cell types and can change under certain physiological conditions, one aim is often to quantify upor down-regulation of individual proteins. Characterisation of proteomic changes associated with disease often helps to shed light on disease mechanisms and identify useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets. It is rarely the case that such proteins are either “present” or “absent”, but more likely that they vary in abundance to different degrees. It is therefore important to have a sensitive and accurate method to measure these changes using an unbiased approach. Shotgun proteomics approaches enable identification of proteins that are up-regulated or down-regulated under specific conditions and this can be studied in different cell and tissue lysates. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQTM) make it possible to both identify and quantify proteins simultaneously. iTRAQTM can easily be multiplexed, enabling analysis of up to 8 different samples within the same experiment. Our objectives in this chapter are to place iTRAQTM (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) in context in the history of attempts to bring quantitative studies to proteomics, to explain what it can do, to describe in some detail the protocol that we use in this laboratory and to illustrate the application of iTRAQTM to medical and clinically-relevant problems, including our own work on the proteomic effects of common drug treatments.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}

Spectroscopy is based on light-matter interactions. This interaction occurs in different ways, and each molecule or an ensemble of molecules will show a distinctive response. The vibrational spectroscopy provides a fingerprint of the vibrational levels of a molecule usually at mid-infrared (MIR) radiation (400-4000cm-1). The optical spectroscopy uses the ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) region (2001000nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and interrogates the electronic levels of a molecule. The instrumentation used to generate and detect this radiation is less complex and cheaper compared to other spectroscopy techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, Xrays, etc. An absorption spectrum is obtained by irradiating a sample and measuring the light which is transformed into other forms of energy, e.g. molecular vibration (heat). A fluorescence spectrum is obtained only from fluorescent molecules, those that absorb and then emit radiation, acquiring the intensity of light emitted as a function of the wavelength.

{"title": "Theoretical Framework of Novel Oxide Compounds for Visible Range Light-Emitting Devices", "abstract": "Composite oxides have been proved to be valuable materials in optoelectronic applications. The combination of indium oxide and gallium oxide and other oxides can lead to enhanced optical and electronic properties, making them suitable for a variety of optoelectronic devices. A favorable energy band gap is needed in the visible region of the spectrum, indicating the applicability in optoelectronic devices such as LEDs and solar cells. Overall band gap engineering and tuning the radiative recombination is a challenge for new age semiconductors. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have become powerful tools in the theoretical study and discovery of oxide materials for LEDs. By analyzing vast datasets, models can predict material properties, optimize synthesis parameters, and even generate new compounds with desired characteristics.

{"title": "De Novo Sequencing of Peptides from High-Resolution Bottom-Up Tandem Mass Spectra using Top-Down Intended Methods", "abstract": "Despite high-resolution mass spectrometers are becoming accessible for more and more laboratories, tandem (MS/MS) mass spectra are still often collected at a low resolution. And even if acquired at a high resolution, software tools used for their processing do not tend to benefit from that in full, and an ability to specify a relative mass tolerance in this case often remains the only feature the respective algorithms take advantage of. We argue that a more efficient way to analyze high-resolution MS/MS spectra should be with methods more explicitly accounting for the precision level, and sustain this claim through demonstrating that a de novo sequencing framework originally developed for (high-resolution) top-down MS/MS data is perfectly suitable for processing high-resolution bottom-up datasets, even though a top-down like deconvolution performed as the first step will leave in many spectra at most a few peaks.", "label": 0, "hard_negative": 1}
